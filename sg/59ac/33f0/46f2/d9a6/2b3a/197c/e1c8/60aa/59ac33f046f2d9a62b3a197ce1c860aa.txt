i
iDENVER (AP) Nikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets were facing some questions
igoing into their first NBA Finals, and their answers came in resounding
ifashion.
i
iNo, a week and a half off didn’t hurt them.
i
iAnd no, the NBA’s biggest stage isn’t too big, either.
i
iJokic got a triple-double in his finals debut, Jamal Murray scored 26 points
iand the Nuggets had little trouble with the cold-shooting Miami Heat on the
iway to a 104-93 win in Game 1 on Thursday night.
i
i“I think that's what the beauty of this team is,” Murray said. “We have so
imany different weapons and so many different looks. You've got to guard
ieverybody. ... Free-flowing, and it's a lot of fun.”
i
iThe Heat had been 3-0 in openers so far in these playoffs, all on the road,
ibut Denver is still unbeaten at home. Game 1 winners in the finals go on to
iwin the title nearly 70% of the time.
i
iAdvantage, Nuggets.
i
i“That was one of my last messages to the group before our game,” Nuggets
icoach Michael Malone said. "I reminded our group, if they didn’t know, that
iMiami went into Milwaukee and won Game 1. They went into the Garden in New
iYork City and won Game 1. They won Game 1 up in Boston. So, we did not want
ithem coming in here taking control of the series on our court."
i
iJokic was the one in control. The two-time NBA MVP finished with 27 points,
i14 assists and 10 rebounds for the Nuggets, who waited 47 years to make the
ifinals and didn’t disappoint.
i
i“The most important thing is to win a game," Jokic said after his ninth
itriple-double of this year's playoffs - his sixth in his last seven games.
i“I’m trying to win a game in any possible way.”
i
iAaron Gordon added 16 points and Michael Porter Jr. scored 14 for Denver,
iwhich trailed for all of 34 seconds and eventually led by as many as 24.
i
iBam Adebayo finished with 26 points and 13 rebounds for Miami, which shot 41%
ifor the game - 33% from 3-point range. Gabe Vincent scored 19, Haywood
iHighsmith had 18 and Jimmy Butler added 13 for the Heat.
i
iMiami was 2 for 2 from the foul line - a night like none other in NBA playoff
ihistory.
i
iIt tied the fewest free throws ever made in a playoff game, broke the record
ifor fewest attempts from the line in a playoff game - the previous record was
ithree - and set NBA Finals records for fewest free throws made and attempted.
iThe Los Angeles Lakers had the previous marks there, going 3 for 5 from the
iline against Philadelphia on May 26, 1983.
i
i“We've got to attack the rim a lot more, myself included,” Butler said.
i
iAdded Adebayo, tongue firmly in cheek: “We made history”
i
iGame 2 is in Denver on Sunday night.
i
iMiami opened the fourth quarter on an 11-0 run, cutting an 84-63 deficit to
istart the final period down to 84-74. The Heat actually got within nine on a
i3-pointer by Highsmith with 2:34 left, but no closer and there wasn't any
idoubt, either.
i
i“It’s a long series,” Vincent said. “First to four wins. Adjustments will be
imade. And we will learn from this loss.”
i
iMalone gave his team a pop quiz in shootaround Thursday morning, peppering
ithem with questions about the game plan and what had to be done in the most
iimportant game to date in franchise history.
i
iThey had all the answers then. Had them all at game time, too. They were the
iteam with minimal NBA Finals experience, only two players having been to the
ititle round before, and yet they looked right at home before the home crowd
iin
iGame 1.
i
i“We were ready,” Denver guard Bruce Brown said.
i
iJokic became the second player in the last 25 years - LeBron James was the
iother, in 2017 - to have 10 assists by halftime of a finals game. He had 10
ipoints and 10 assists by the break, and Denver was up 59-42 after the first
itwo quarters - with Jokic taking only three shots.
i
i“I don’t need to shoot and I know I don’t need to score to affect the game,"
iJokic said.
i
iMeanwhile, the Heat just couldn’t shoot. At all. Or at least, not until
iDenver was too far ahead to catch.
i
iCaleb Martin, who narrowly missed out on winning the MVP award of the Eastern
iConference finals, was 1 for 7. And Max Strus was 0 for 10, 0 for 9 on
i3-pointers, and became just the second player in the last 45 years to take
ithat many shots without a make in a finals game.
i
iThe other, somewhat surprisingly: Ray Allen, a past Heat finals hero who was
i0 for 13 for Boston against the Los Angeles Lakers in 2010.
i
i“I didn’t even look at the box score yet, but like I said, I think the
idisposition, the efforts were more appropriate in the second half,” Heat
icoach
iErik Spoelstra said. “But that’s not enough. It has to be for a full game,
iand
iyou also have to make some plays when you’re beat.”
i
iTIP-INS
i
iHeat: Miami fell to 1-6 all-time in Game 1s of the NBA Finals. The Heat lost
ithe series opener in each of their title years - 2006, 2012 and 2013 - and
ithe
ionly win came in 2011, a series they eventually lost to Dallas. … Adebayo's
i25
ishots were a career high. He became the third player to score at least 24
ipoints for Miami in a Game 1 of a finals. James did it three times for the
iHeat and Dwyane Wade did it in 2006.
i
iNuggets: Jokic became the eighth player to have a triple-double in Game 1 of
ia finals. None of the others were accompanied by 27 points; Dave Cowens had a
i25-point triple-double to open the 1976 finals. ... Brown, who played his
icollege ball at Miami, scored 10. … Denver got to the foul line 20 times.
i
iCELEB WATCH
i
iAmong those in the sellout crowd: Grammy winner H.E.R., former Denver
iquarterback Peyton Manning, current Denver quarterback Russell Wilson,
iBroncos
icoach Sean Payton and actor-comedian Ken Jeong.
