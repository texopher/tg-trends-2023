iNikola Jokic was the most obvious target of the Miami Heat’s zonal defensive
istructure. So what did Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone do? He made the
i6-foot-11 Serbian the main playmaker.
i
iBy putting Jokic on distribution duty, space opened up under the basket -
isomething Aaron Gordon and Jamal Murray took advantage of as the Nuggets took
iGame 1 104-93.
i
iMiami's abysmal shooting performance sunk them as the Nuggets took Game 1 at
ihome as they only went 39-96 from the field and 13-39 from 3-point range.
iThey
ialso set a record for the least free throw attempts in a Finals game, with
ijust two shots.
i
iMVP candidate Nikola Jokic was the most impactful performer of the night -
iputting up a triple-double of 27 points, 10 rebounds, and 14 assists.
i
iIt was a record breaking night for Jokic. He became the first player to drop
ia triple-double in his finals debut since Jason Kidd in 2002. In addition, he
isurpassed Bill Russell's record for most assists by a center.
i
i'The first three rounds they won the first game and that they traveled and
iplayed on the road and we didn't wanna have that happen,' Jokic said after
ithe
igame. 'I think we did a good job to hold that team to 93 points is a really
igood job.'
i
iJamal Murray's 26 points helped the Denver Nuggets in their 104-93 win over
ithe Miami Heat
i
iNikola Jokic grabbed a triple-double, putting up 27 points, 10 rebounds, and
i14 assists
i
iJokic broke Bill Russell's Finals single-game record for assists by a center
iwith 14 on the night
i
iJamal Murray shone bright for Denver - finishing with 26 points, ten assists,
iand six rebounds. Aaron Gordon's hot start helped him finish with 16 points
iand six rebounds.
i
iBam Adebayo was the top performer for the Heat with a 13-25 shooting
iperformance that led to 26 points and 13 rebounds. Haywood Highsmith was also
ia key contributor for Miami - putting up 18 points off the bench.
i
iBut for the most part, Miami's role players that helped them get here went
ilargely silent.
i
iWhile Gabe Vincent did well by putting up 19 points, fellow starters Caleb
iMartin and Max Strus - who have both put up great performances in these
iplayoffs - did not. Martin and Strus combined for just three points on a 1-17
ishooting line, including a 1-11 line from beyond the arc.
i
iBut star player Jimmy Butler was held in check as Gordon defended him well.
iButler went 6-14 for 13 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists.
i
iBam Adebayo (13) was Miami's best player on the night - putting up a
idouble-double
i
iBut Miami role players Caleb Martin and Max Strus shot a combined 1-17 on the
inight
i
iEven star player Jimmy Butler was off - putting up only 13 points in the
ilosing effort
i
iIt was a monster start to the game by Gordon - Denver's role playing power
iforward. The former All-Star slipped and slid around Miami’s zone defense -
iopening up space in the paint and putting up 12 points on 6-8 shooting in
ijust
ithe first quarter alone.
i
iJokic to racked up six assists in the first quarter alone, letting the
ioffense run through him.
i
iHe didn’t even take a shot until three seconds remained in the quarter. After
iKentavious Caldwell-Pope missed a shot, Miami’s Cody Zeller rebounded the
iball. Jokic swatted it out of his hands, caught a pass from Gordon, and put
iit
iin the basket.
i
iOn the other side of the court, Miami's Bam Adebayo shot an impressive 4-6
ifor eight points as the Heat remained close by the end of the first quarter.
i
iBut Murray set the tone for the rest of the game as he and Michael Porter Jr.
iopened up quarter number two by letting the 3-point shots fly to increase
itheir lead to 35-24.
i
iRole players on both teams got in on the scoring as Denver's Jeff Green and
iMiami's Duncan Robinson and Haywood Highsmith grabbed buckets.
i
iMiami shortened the deficit thanks to three straight shots hit by Kyle Lowry,
iAdebayo, and Highsmith - but Denver almost always found a response.
i
iBut Murray really began pouring it on - hitting a crucial 3-pointer to bring
ihis point total to 18 at the half.
i
iAaron Gordon and Denver took advantage of Miami's zone early - taking a first
iquarter lead
i
iJamal Murray had an impressive second quarter that set the tone for the rest
iof the game
i
iBy the time the buzzer sounded on the half, Jokic had already completed a
idouble-double with 10 points and 10 assists off some sublime passing.
i
iMurray didn't slow down his scoring as the third quarter got underway -
iscoring Denver's first six points of the quarter.
i
iBam Adebayo began to take his chance to exert himself for Miami's offense.
iThe big man finished the quarter with a total of 24 points on 12-23 shooting.
i
iBut the rest of Miami struggled to show up in this quarter. By the time three
iframes were through, the Heat were shooting an appalling 27-76 (35.5 percent)
ifrom the field and 7-27 (25.9 percent) from 3-point range.
i
iMiami began to heat up in the fourth quarter - putting up an 11-0 run. But by
ithen, it was too late. Jokic, who had started that final quarter on the
ibench,
icame back onto the court and put up the stats he needed to close out his epic
ifeat.
