iAccording to reports, Jamie Foxx is now "paralyzed and blind" from a
iblood clot in his brain after receiving the COVID-19 "vaccine." Those
iof us who spoke against the mRNA shot were attacked in every
iimaginable way. I am infuriated a decent person like Jamie Foxx fell
ivictim to Big Pharma because a movie set is still dumb enough to
imandate their cash cow clot shot.

iJamie Foxx should sue Pfizer...oh that's right, never mind. They have

iWhy is Trump still touting his clot shot?
