i
iHorrific health details have been revealed regarding Jamie Foxx’s mysterious
imedical state.
i
iThe Django Unchained star is said to be "partially paralyzed and blind," in
iaddition to a series of other complications after receiving the COVID-19
ivaccine, Hollywood journalist A.J. Benza claimed after speaking to a source
iclose to Foxx.
i
i"Jamie had a blood clot in his brain after he got the shot. He did not want
ithe shot, but the movie he was on, he was pressured to get it," confessed the
ipodcaster — who formally worked as a columnist for the New York Daily News
iand
ias a host of the E! series Mysteries and Scandals — during an appearance on
iDr. Drew Pinsky’s online show "Ask Dr. Drew."
i
i"The blood clot in the brain caused him at that point to be partially
iparalyzed and blind," Benza alleged, as he insisted his insider was "someone
iin the room" with first-hand knowledge of Foxx’s hospitalization.
i
i"I am thinking, 'Is that why he blew up on the set a week before this medical
iemergency happened?'" the veteran journalist asked Pinsky. "Is that why he
ifired three or four people because he had had it with these mandates?"
i
iFoxx was admitted to the hospital after suffering a "medical complication" on
iThursday, April 11, although specific details on his current health status
ihave been difficult to discover.
i
iThe 55-year-old’s medical woes mounted while filming his latest movie Back in
iAction. The movie, also starring Cameron Diaz, has moved forward with
iproduction without Foxx, using a body double in his place.
i
iOn Friday, May 12, Foxx's daughter Corrine announced conflicting information
ithat didn’t align with numerous other reports regarding the actor's
iwell-being.
i
i"Sad to see how the media runs wild. My dad has been out of the hospital for
iweeks, recuperating," Foxx’s daughter insisted. "In fact, he was playing
ipickleball yesterday! Thanks for everyone’s prayers and support! We have an
iexciting work announcement coming next week too!"

i
iBenza addressed the family statement on his podcast, calling the pickleball
iclaims "all lies" and "baloney."
i
i"If you read into what they were saying early on, 'He is communicating with
ius.' That doesn’t mean talking. That could be anything. Writing. Sign
ilanguage. I know those little code words," Benza continued to assume of
iFoxx's
icurrent capabilities.
i
i"Then you tell me your father is playing pickleball, give me a break. There
iis a great shroud of secrecy around Jamie Foxx," he added.
i
iPinsky provided his two cents on the matter, stating: "Blood in the brain is
ia cerebral bleed. It is not a stroke. A stroke is a blood clot in an artery
ito
ithe brain that cuts off the blood supply to the brain and the brain dies."
i
i"It has been widely known that he had a stroke, right? They have said stroke
imany times. To say it is a blood clot in the brain, it is a stroke. It is a
iblood clot in an artery that cuts off the supply … that part of the brain is
idead," the television personality continued.
i
iPinsky concluded: "It has very serious consequences. It depends on which
iartery and what the anatomy of that artery is to what parts of the brain and
iwhat not."
