i
iThe first-ever NBA Finals game in Denver went according to plan for the home
iteam.
i
iNikola Jokic's spectacular night led the Nuggets to a 104-93 win over the
iHeat at Ball Arena. The Serbian superstar posted his ninth triple-double of
ithis year's playoffs, finishing with 27 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds.
i
iIt wasn't just his stats that caught the eye, it was the way he compiled
ithem. Jokic treated fans to a stunning display, dominating all facets of the
igame despite not even taking a shot until near the end of the first quarter.
iHis passing, playmaking and finishing helped Denver hold off a late Miami
irally and take the first step towards a title in 2023.
i
iBam Adebayo was stellar for the Heat, but a lack of support from his
iteammates meant his efforts were in vain. He finished with a team-high 26
ipoints, 13 rebounds and five assists. Gabe Vincent was second on the team
iwith
i19 points, while Jimmy Butler had his worst game of the postseason with just
i13 points.
i
iThe win means the Nuggets are still undefeated at home in this year's
iplayoffs, with a perfect record of 9-0 inside Ball Arena. It was the Heat's
ifirst loss in a Game 1 this postseason, and they now also trail in a series
ifor the first time.

i
i10:45 p.m. ‚Äî Jokic finishes as the game's top scorer with 27 points to go
iwith 14 assists and 10 rebounds. Adebayo (26 points, 13 rebounds, five
iassists) did everything he could for Miami, but he simply didn't get enough
ihelp from his teammates. Murray (26 points, 10 assists, six rebounds) was
ialso
ia standout performer for Denver.
i
i10:43 p.m. FINAL ‚Äî The final buzzer sounds and Denver stays perfect at home
iin these playoffs. The Nuggets win Game 1, 104-93.

i
i10:40 p.m. ‚Äî There's the triple-double for Jokic ‚Äî his ninth of the
ipostseason. Just a generational talent. The clock has ticked under a minute
iremaining, and this game is just about over. The Nuggets are going to take a
i1-0 series lead in their first-ever NBA Finals.

i
i10:37 p.m. ‚Äî Jokic is trying to drag his team over the finish line right now.
iHe hits back-to-back buckets, but Haywood Highsmith connects from deep to cut
ithe deficit to just nine points. That's the smallest lead of the half for
iDenver. But with less than two and a half minutes remaining, it's probably
itoo
ilittle, too late for Miami.
i
i10:34 p.m. ‚Äî Adebayo serves up a dime to Butler to set up an easy slam. A
ifrustrated Michael Malone calls a timeout, and the Nuggets now lead 92-80
iwith
i4:21 left in the game. Butler has been relatively quiet tonight with just 13
ipoints on 6-of-14 shooting.
i
i10:27 p.m. ‚Äî But the Nuggets throw a counterpunch with four straight points
ifrom Jokic to stretch the lead back to 16 points. He now has 19 points to go
iwith 13 assists and nine rebounds tonight.
i
i10:19 p.m. ‚Äî Well, that's not a bad start to a comeback! The Heat sink three
ithree-pointers in a row (the first from Vincent, the second two from Lowry)
ito
icut the lead to just ten points as the clock ticks under ten minutes
iremaining. This team simply refuses to quit.

i
i10:10 p.m. END OF THIRD QUARTER ‚Äî Barring a wild comeback, the Nuggets are
igoing to cruise to a win here in Game 1. The final points of the third
iquarter
icame on a three by Lowry, but it only serves to cut the deficit to 21 points.
iIt's 84-63 Denver with one quarter left to play.
i
i10:04 p.m. ‚Äî Bruce Brown knocks down a triple, and Erik Spoelstra has seen
ienough. He takes a timeout to try and coach up his team with time winding
idown
iin the quarter. Denver leads 79-60 with 2:51 remaining in the third.

i
i10:00 p.m. ‚Äî Adebayo is having a really impressive night. Unfortunately for
ithe Heat, he is the only one on his team who can say that. Another made
ijumper
ihas him up to 24 points for the game, but Miami still trails by 17 points
iafter a triple from Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.
i
i9:56 p.m. ‚Äî Jokic swishes a three of his own to extend the lead back to 16
ipoints. He's shooting it at an incredible 47 percent clip from deep so far
ithis postseason. Just when the Heat started to pick up some momentum, the
iNuggets answer with a run of their own.
i
i9:48 p.m. ‚Äî The Heat start the quarter with a nice little offensive flurry.
iAdebayo continues his excellent night with a pair of midrange buckets, then
iGabe Vincent sinks a three to quickly cut the deficit to just ten points.
i
i9:45 p.m. START OF THIRD QUARTER ‚Äî The second half is underway. Can Miami
ifind a way back into this game?
i
i9:34 p.m. ‚Äî Murray leads all scorers with 18 points, while Adebayo is close
ibehind with 16. Jokic already has a double-double, with ten points and ten
iassists at the break.
i
i9:29 p.m. END OF FIRST HALF ‚Äî Fantastic end to the half for Denver! Murray
idrains a triple before Jokic connects a short shot to extend the lead to 17
ipoints. That's how the half will end after a Kyle Lowry attempt at the buzzer
iis off the mark. The Nuggets take a commanding 59-42 lead into the locker
iroom.

i
i9:27 p.m. ‚Äî Martin makes a nice defensive play to force a turnover, and it
isets up a wide open three-point look for Max Strus ‚Äî but he can't connect.
iHe's had a very rough night so far and is zero-of-seven from the field. On
ithe
ibright side for Miami, Adebayo has been great offensively, and he is up to 16
ipoints for the game.
i
i9:21 p.m. ‚Äî Jokic is starting to get it going now. He drives inside on
iZeller, who goes flying to the floor, and finishes to take his total to eight
ipoints on the night. It also gives the Nuggets their biggest lead of the game
iso far. They are up 50-37 with 3:20 remaining in the first half.
i
i9:16 p.m. ‚Äî Porter Jr. looks just fine as he blows by Adebayo and throws down
ia big one-handed slam. The Heat are starting to find their groove a bit more
ioffensively, but the Nuggets are keeping them at arm's length.

i
i9:13 p.m. ‚Äî Porter Jr. is down hurt after taking an accidental shot to the
iface from Bam Adebayo. The good news is he looked like he would be alright as
ihe walked to the sideline. The Nuggets still lead, 39-31.
i
i9:10 p.m. ‚Äî Another Nugget off to a great start is Murray, who just buried a
itriple to reach 11 points for the game. Denver is in full control right now
iup
iby ten points early in the second quarter.

i
i9:01 p.m. END OF FIRST QUARTER ‚Äî And right on cue, there's Jokic with his
ifirst bucket of the night. He pokes the ball away from Cody Zeller to set up
ia
iwide open layup under the rim, and the first quarter ends with Denver leading
i29-20. Another great start at home for the Nuggets in a postseason full of
ithem.
i
i8:55 p.m. ‚Äî One interesting note ‚Äî Jokic has yet to take a single shot from
ithe field almost ten minutes into this game. That's unusual for Denver, but
iit's working so far for Michael Malone. The Serbian superstar does already
ihave six assists under his belt, however.
i
i8:51 p.m. ‚Äî Gordon is absolutely going off right now! Another pair of lay-ins
ihas taken his tally to 12 points in the first quarter, and the Nuggets have
ibuilt a seven-point lead with 1:59 remaining in the opening frame.
i
i8:47 p.m. ‚Äî Aaron Gordon is off to a fantastic start for the Nuggets. The
iforward is up to eight points on four-of-six shooting, the latest of which
icame on a tough post-up over Caleb Martin. Denver leads 14-9 at the first
itimeout of the evening.

i
i8:44 p.m. ‚Äî The first points of the series belong to Jamal Murray, who hits a
idriving layup in the opening seconds. But Butler is off to a hot start as
iwell. He knocks down a jumper then cans a triple to take his tally to five
ipoints in the early going.
