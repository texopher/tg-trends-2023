i===== Nikola Jokic, Nuggets cruise to Game 1 win over Heat =====
i
iWell aware of their opponent's penchant for fast starts, the Denver Nuggets
itreated their first-ever NBA Finals game as if everything were on the line.
i
iEven with the Game 1 urgency, Nuggets star Nikola Jokic never panicked,
ifinishing off another triple-double with 27 points, 10 rebounds and 14
iassists
ias the Nuggets rolled to a 104-93 victory Thursday against the visiting Miami
iHeat.
i
iGame 2 of the best-of-seven series is scheduled for Sunday in Denver.
i
iJamal Murray scored 26 points and handed out 10 assists, Michael Porter Jr.
iadded 14 points and 13 rebounds and Aaron Gordon had 16 points as the Nuggets
iwon the series opener without having to lean heavily on Jokic, even as he
iended up leading the way.
i
i"Right now, the most important thing is to win a game, and I'm trying to win
ia game in any possible way," Jokic said on the ABC broadcast. "I don't need
ito
ishoot and I know I don't need to score to affect the game, and I think I did
ia
igood job today. Everybody contributed."
i
iJokic wound up 8 of 12 from the field after taking just five shots through
ithree quarters. He extended his NBA single-year record with his ninth
itriple-double of the playoffs.
i
iDenver, the Western Conference's top seed, shot 59.5 percent from the field
iin the first half and 50.6 percent for the game while improving to 9-0 at
ihome
iin the playoffs. The Nuggets were sharp, even after a nine-day wait between
itheir conference-final sweep and the start of the NBA Finals.
i
iBam Adebayo amassed 26 points and 13 rebounds for the Heat, but Jimmy Butler
iwas held to 13 points on 6-of-14 shooting. The No. 8 seed in the Eastern
iConference failed to win the opener of a series on the road for the first
itime
iin four tries.
i
i"I reminded our group, if they didn't know, that Miami went into Milwaukee
i(in the first round) and won Game 1," Nuggets head coach Michael Malone said.
i"They went into the Garden in New York City (in the second round) and won
iGame
i1. They won Game 1 up in Boston (in the Eastern Conference finals). So we did
inot want them coming in here, taking control of the series on our court."
i
iGabe Vincent scored 19 points while Haywood Highsmith added 18 for the Heat,
iwho shot 37.5 percent in the first half and 40.6 percent on the night. Miami
iwas 2 of 2 from the free-throw line, an NBA Finals record for least number of
ifree-throw attempts in a playoff game.
i
i"They were in a pretty good rhythm, especially in that first half," Heat
icoach Erik Spoelstra said of the Nuggets. "Our disposition, the efforts, the
iresolve in the second half was much better. But (when) you get to this level,
iit has to be complete games of that disposition."
i
iJokic was content to occupy the role of playmaker in the first quarter, not
itaking his first shot from the field until 3.3 seconds remained. He made the
iclose-range attempt as Denver took a 29-20 lead at the end of the opening
iperiod.
i
iThe Nuggets opened their first double-digit lead at 32-22 on a 3-pointer by
iMurray with 10:31 remaining in the first half, and the hosts led 59-42 at
ihalftime.
i
iDenver grabbed its first lead of at least 20 points at 81-60 with 2:08
iremaining in the third quarter, on a pull-up jumper from Bruce Brown. The
iNuggets went into the fourth quarter with an 84-63 advantage.
i
iThe Heat opened the final period on an 11-0 run to get within 84-74 with 9:29
iremaining. The Nuggets seized control again, taking a 90-74 lead with 7:16
ileft on a layup from Jokic, and closed out the victory from there.
i
i"I definitely think (the Nuggets) came out with a lot of physicality, and we
ihave to be able to match that," said Butler, who insisted he was not affected
iby the effort expended to win the Eastern Conference finals in seven games.
i"They did their job on their home floor. You have to say that. But we will be
iready, we will adjust and do things differently."
