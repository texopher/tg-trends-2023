i===== Heat vs. Nuggets Game 1 live updates =====
i
iEnd of Game 1 - The Nuggets win Game 1convincingly behind a triple-double
ifrom Nikola Jokic, defeating the Heat 104-93. Nuggets -8.5 hits, as does the
iunder on 219. If you had Nuggets moneyline, you’re a winner as well. The
iNuggets were able to maintain their offensive efficiency for four quarters,
iwhile the Heat couldn’t get to the free-throw line or hit enough threes. It’s
ia 1-0 lead for Denver heading into Game 2 Sunday.

i
iFourth quarter - The Heat got the deficit to single digits at one point but
ithe Nuggets once again responded to create some separation late in Game 1.
iMiami simply doesn’t have enough time or consistency right now to pull this
ione off. It looks like Denver will take Game 1 and maintain its perfect home
irecord in the playoffs.
i
iFourth quarter - The Nuggets have responded slightly to Miami’s run, as they
ihave a double-digit lead once again. Jokic is still one rebound away from a
itriple-double but he’s now up to 19 points for the game. The Heat have still
inot played. Butler in this quarter, and we’ll see if they opt to go to him
iwith this game slowly starting to slip out of reach.

i
iFourth quarter - The Heat have cut into the deficit with an 8-0 run to start
ithe fourth quarter, which was headlined by two made triples. If Miami’s
ithree-point shooting can show positive regression, there’s a chance the Heat
ican keep eating into this deficit. They trail Denver 84-71 with just over 10
iminutes left in Game 1.

i
iEnd of the third quarter - This has been all Denver in Game 1, with the
iNuggets holding a massive 21-point lead. It feels larger given Miami’s
iinability to hit any sort of shot. Jokic is one rebound away from a
itriple-double, while Murray, Porter Jr. and Gordon have combined for 52
ipoints. Nuggets -8.5 is looking like a lock. The under on 219 is looking
isolid
ias well, especially if the Nuggets ease off with a big lead.
i
iThird quarter - The Heat continue to struggle offensively, and Denver has now
iopened up a 19-point lead as the third quarter winds down. Jokic, Murray and
iPorter Jr. are all locked in, while the Heat can’t get much out of anyone
iother than Adebayo. Unless Miami is able to clean some things up defensively,
ithis one is going to be a slow bleed the rest of the way.
i
iThird quarter - It’s been all Jokic and the Nuggets in the third quarter
iafter a quick spurt from Miami. Denver is back up by 16 points, with Jokic up
ito 14 points and 11 assists. Murray has 24 points, five rebounds and five
iassists. On the flip side, Strus hasn’t made a single triple in 10 attempts.
iThe Heat have shot 5-21 from behind the arc. That’s not going to win you many
igames, and it certainly isn’t going to win you games against this Nuggets
iteam.
i
iThird quarter - The Heat had a quick 7-0 run going to start the second half
ibut Murray made a key play on both sides of the ball to quickly put the
iNuggets back up by double digits. The Heat have been unable to string
itogether
igood offensive possessions consistently, and Butler has struggled to get
igoing.
i
iHalftime - Here are some more halftime stats for Game 1. The Nuggets posted
i59.5/45.5/100 shooting splits in the first half, while the Heat posted
i37.5/23.5/100 splits. Denver won on the glass and had more assists, and it
imakes sense why the Nuggets have a 17-point lead. We’ll see if Miami can make
isome dents into this deficit over the second half or if Denver keeps building
ion this advantage.
i
iHalftime - It’s been a dominant first half for the Nuggets, who hold a 59-42
ilead over the Heat in Game 1 at halftime. Jokic leads the way with 10 points
iand 10 assists, while Murray has poured in 18 points. Adebayo has 16 for the
iHeat, who have gone 4-17 from behind the arc so far. It’s been all Nuggets
iand
ithem winning with the cover is looking great right now. The under on 219 is
ialso looking excellent.

i
iSecond quarter - The Heat have not been able to connect from behind the arc
iin this game, shooting 3-13 from the perimeter so far. Jokic has been
iphenomenal as expected with eight points, eight assists and three rebounds
iwhile Gordon and Murray have combined for 25 points. The Nuggets have opened
iup a 50-37 lead with just over three minutes to go in the first half.
i
iSecond quarter - Porter Jr. took a shot from Adebayo on a loose ball but the
iplay was not blown dead and the Heat were able to get an easy layup. The
iNuggets still hold a 39-31 lead.
i
iSecond quarter - Michael Porter Jr. has hit his second triple of the game as
ithe Nuggets have opened up a double-digit advantage. Murray has also hit a
itriple in this quarter as Denver tries to break Miami’s zone defense. The
iHeat
ihad success zoning the Celtics but the Nuggets might have better overall
ishooting to beat it.
i
iEnd of the first quarter - The Nuggets hold a 29-20 lead over the Heat at the
iend of the first quarter, so there’s been little rust despite having more
ithan
ia week off. Miami has missed some easy shots, but has not done well defending
iDenver in the halfcourt. At the moment, Nuggets -8.5 is looking solid. The
iunder on 219 is looking promising as well.
i
iFirst quarter - It’s 27-20 Nuggets with just under two minutes left in the
ifirst quarter. Gordon has been cooking with 12 points, and the Heat simply
idon’t have an answer for him in the paint. Nikola Jokic already has five
iassists but hasn’t taken a shot yet. Murray has eight points early. For the
iHeat, Butler has seven points and Bam Adebayo has come alive with eight
ipoints.
i
iFirst quarter - We’ve hit the first timeout of Game 1 and it’s been the Aaron
iGordon show so far. He’s got eight points on 4-6 shooting as the Nuggets have
ijumped out to a 14-9 lead. Jimmy Butler leads the Heat with five points.
