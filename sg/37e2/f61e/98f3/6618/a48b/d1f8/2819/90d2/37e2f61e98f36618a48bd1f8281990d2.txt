i===== Early life and education =====
i
iBorn in Terrell, Texas,[4] Foxx is the son of Darrell Bishop (renamed Shahid
iAbdula following his conversion to Islam),[5] who sometimes worked as a
istockbroker, and Louise Annette Talley Dixon. Shortly after his birth, Foxx
iwas adopted and raised by his mother's adoptive parents, Estelle Marie
i(Nelson), a domestic worker and nursery operator, and Mark Talley, a yard
iworker.[6][7][8] He has had little contact with his birth parents, who were
inot part of his upbringing.[9] He was raised in the black quarter of Terrell,
iwhich at the time was a racially segregated community.[9] He has often
iacknowledged his grandmother's influence as one of the greatest reasons for
ihis success.[7][10]
i
iFoxx began playing the piano when he was five years old.[11] He had a strict
iBaptist upbringing[7][12] and as a teenager was a part-time pianist and choir
ileader in Terrell's New Hope Baptist Church.[9] His natural talent for
itelling
ijokes was already in evidence as a third grader, when his teacher used him as
ia reward: if the class behaved well, Foxx would tell them jokes. He attended
iTerrell High School, where he received top grades and played basketball and
ifootball (as quarterback). His ambition was to play for the Dallas Cowboys,
iand he was the first player in the school's history to pass for more than
i1,000 yards.[9][13] He also sang in a band called Leather and Lace.[9] After
ihigh school, Foxx received a scholarship to United States International
iUniversity, where he studied musical and performing arts composition.[9][14]
i
i===== Career =====
i
iFoxx first told jokes at a comedy club's open mic night in 1989, after
iaccepting a girlfriend's dare. When he found that female comedians were often
icalled first to perform, he chose the stage name of Jamie Foxx, which he felt
iwas ambiguous enough to disallow any biases,[9][15] with his surname being a
itribute to the black comedian Redd Foxx.[15] Foxx joined the cast of In
iLiving
iColor in 1991, where his recurrent character Wanda also shared a name with
iRedd's friend and co-worker, LaWanda Page. Following a recurring role in the

iFoxx Show, from 1996 to 2001, which he also co-created and produced through
ihis company Foxx Hole Productions and was aired on the The WB Network.
i
iFoxx made his film debut in the 1992 comedy Toys. His first dramatic role
icame in Oliver Stone's 1999 film Any Given Sunday, where he was cast as a

ibackground.[7] During filming, Foxx fought with costar LL Cool J.[17][18]

idrama Ali. Three years later, Foxx played taxi driver Max Durocher in the
iMann
ifilm Collateral alongside Tom Cruise, for which he received outstanding
ireviews. Critic Roger Ebert praised Foxx's performance calling him a "Jamie
iFoxx's work is a revelation. I've thought of him in terms of comedy ("Booty
iCall," "Breakin' all the Rules"), but here he steps into a dramatic lead and
iis always convincing and involving".[19] He went on to received a nomination
ifor the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[7]
i
