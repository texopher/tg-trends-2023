i
iRuben Neves will become the first Premier League player to make a big money
imove to Saudi Arabia this summer.
i
iThe Wolves captain is heading for Al Hilal in a £47million switch, with a
ideal due to be completed when he finishes on international duty with
iPortugal.
iAl Hilal are newly minted after being one of the four Saudi clubs taken over
iby the country's Public Investment Fund - also owners of Newcastle United -
iin
irecent weeks.
i
iThe switch will bring to an end Neves' six-year stint at Molineux, having
ijoined from Porto in 2017 for £16million, with Wanderers now pocketing a
imajor
iprofit on a player who has just one year left on his contract.
i
iAfter saying his goodbyes to fans at Molineux on the penultimate weekend of
ilast season, after 253 appearances and 30 goals in old gold, Neves is finally
iset for pastures new.
i
iBut why is a player who has starred in the Premier League, with a contract
irunning down, an agent as connected as Jorge Mendes and reported interest
ifrom
iBarcelona, following Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema and heading to the
iSaudi Pro League at the age of just 26?
i
iIs it merely all about the money?
i
iHis departure will ease some of the financial fair play issues at Molineux
iwhich had put Julen Lopetegui's future at the club in question.
i
iThe Spaniard confirmed he would be staying in the Black Country last week,
ibut only after heading back to his homeland to contemplate his future and the
iprospect of walking away.
i
iThe ex-Real Madrid and Sevilla boss did a tremendous job to keep Wolves up
iafter taking over with the side bottom of the table. But Lopetegui spent in
iexcess of £75million in January, money that hadn't been budgeted for last
iterm. Ultimately that money had to come from somewhere, and according to the
iclub's sporting director Matt Hobbs, they find themselves working "within FFP
ilimitations" this summer.
i
iAs such, the big money exit of Neves - their most valuable asset - will ease
ithe financial burden that the club is under and allow the Lopetegui-Hobbs
idouble act greater wriggle room from which to further overhaul the squad.
i
iDespite Joao Moutinho having also already departed this summer, Lopetegui is
ihappy with his central midfield options in the deep position Neves usually
ioccupies; Mario Lemina, Joao Gomes, Boubacar Traore, Matheus Nunes and Joe
iHodge are all in situ. The focus will now be on bringing in a player who can
ioffer a goal threat arriving in opposition penalty boxes from a central
imidfield berth.
i
iImage:
i
iCertainly. The wonderkid that arrived at the age of 20 has matured and was
ithe dressing room leader last term, following Conor Coady's loan move to
iEverton. During a difficult campaign, in which they were dire pre-World Cup
iand much improved post-Qatar - ultimately finishing 13th - he was Wolves'
ibest
iplayer. He will go down as a modern-day club legend.
i
iHowever, while Neves has loved his time at the club, after six years he
iwanted to make a forward step in his career, namely to play in the Champions
iLeague. He admitted in May after what was ultimately his final match at
iMolineux, a 1-1 draw with Everton: “I want to be here but I never hide that I
iwant to play Champions League football.
i
i"It’s a hard decision. Me and my family love it here, but in football you
ihave to go for your main goals. If it was my last game here I really enjoyed
iit and I’m very thankful for the last six seasons.”
i
iClub chiefs wanted to give him that and with one year left on his deal were
ihappy to cash in for the right fee. There is a good relationship between
iNeves
iand those at the top of the club, and, interestingly, had he still been at
iWolves at the start of next season, a new contract, on improved terms, would
ihave been signed - something which has helped them negotiate a club record
ifee.
i
iImage:
i
iSimply, because Al Hilal's bid is the only offer that has appeared at Wolves'
idoor.
i
iFor the third successive summer, Wolves haven't had a major Premier League or
iEuropean offer. In 2021 he was offered around by his agency, Gestifute, with
iWolves owners Fosun willing to cash in, but there were no takers and 12
imonths
iago there was again no worthwhile bid forthcoming.
i
iWhile Neves is unquestionably talented, deemed in some quarters as a
i'Champions League calibre' performer and has been monitored by a number of
iEurope's elite, none have ever decided to make a serious move. A number of
iclubs have liked him in the past and a it's understood some had him on their
imidfield shortlists this summer too.
i
iBut he has never been the No.1 choice, instead always lower down the pecking
iorder and a guy they'd perhaps turn to if they couldn't get their top
itargets.
iThis summer is set to be dominated by high-profile midfielders making moves -
ikicked off already by England sensation Jude Bellingham, whose £87million
imove
ito Real Madrid was revealed initially by Mirror Sport last month - but while
ithe likes of Arsenal, Newcastle, Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain and
iBarcelona, plus others, are all looking to make moves in that area, Neves
iwasn't at the top of any of their lists.
i
iNeves had been keen to fulfil a boyhood dream and move to Barcelona this
isummer. That was his No.1 choice and his agent, Jorge Mendes, had attempted
ito
ibroker a deal with Camp Nou chiefs to take his client to Catalunya.
i
iBut Barcelona's much publicised financial issues made a deal for Neves to
ireplace outgoing club legend Sergio Busquets a non-starter. The Blaugrana
isimply aren't in a position to spend big money right now, particularly on a
iplayer who isn't their first choice - Manchester City's Ilkay Gundogan is the
imidfielder they want - and who, in all likelihood, would be back up to the
icurrent trio in situ, Gavi, Pedri and Frenkie de Jong.
i
iThere was also the issue that Barca head coach Xavi Hernandez has never had
iNeves down as one of the players that he particularly wanted despite the
iongoing speculation. He prefers to keep the aforementioned trio plus carry on
iworking with Frank Kessie, the Ivory Coast midfielder who joined on a free
itransfer from AC Milan last summer.
i
iThat left Neves without the move he wanted most, leaving both he and Wolves
iin limbo yet again.... until the Saudi offer was presented to the Wanderers
icaptain.
i
iImage:
i
iCertainly for Wolves. This deal arrived last week and gives them everything
ithey want in terms of the fee and, just as crucially, it gets it done early
iand allows them to move forwards with their summer plans, while, so
imentioned,
ieasing their FFP issues.
i
iFor Neves, it appears so too. He's said to be excited by taking on a
idifferent challenge, has spoken to Ronaldo while on international duty - like
ihis international teammate, he'll be based in Riyadh - about the league and
ithe lifestyle he and his family will have.
i
iAnd, let's make no mistake, Neves will be getting paid very, very well, far
imore than he was making at Wolves. Neves is likely to receive in excess of
i£300k-per-week UNTAXED; had a Premier League side been in for him and looked
ito match such a figure, they would have had to commit to putting over
i£600k-a-week on their books.
i
iThe country's sovereign wealth fund, which already owns Newcastle United and
ihas now become all powerful in golf following the merger of the PGA Tour and
ithe LIV rebels, has taken control of four of its top clubs: Al Hilal, Al
iAhli,
iAl Ittihad and Al Nassr.
i
iThe privatisation plan has been spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin
iSalman, and is seen as key as the kingdom looks to increase league revenues
ifourfold by 2030 - part of the country’s ‘Vision 2030’ project, which also
iinvolves an attempt to host that year's World Cup - with the Saudi state news
iagency, SPA, also declaring: “The Saudi Pro League… will be supported in its
iambition to be amongst the top 10 leagues in the world."
i
iThat means spending big on world stars like Ronaldo, at Al Nassr since
iJanuary, and Benzema, who recently quit Real Madrid for Al Ittihad. Others,
ilike Chelsea trio N'Golo Kante, Kalidou Koulibaly and Pierre-Emerick
iAubameyang, are expected to join, as could ex-Barcelona pair Jordi Alba and
iSergio Busquets.
i
iAll will be paid huge wages as Saudi Arabia looks to use football and its
ifinancial power to enhance the country's global reputation. Neves is somewhat
iunique, in that he moves with his career still yet to reach its apex, while
ihis transfer fee is itself a new record for the Saudi league.
