i
i===== Early and personal life =====
i
iKhawaja was born in Islamabad, Pakistan to Tariq Khawaja and Fozia Tariq. His
ifamily emigrated to New South Wales when he was four. He became the first
iAustralian of Pakistani origin to represent Australia in cricket when he made
ihis debut in the 2010–11 Ashes series. He is a qualified commercial and
iinstrument-rated pilot, completing a bachelor's degree in aviation from the
iUniversity of New South Wales before he made his Test debut. He attained his
ibasic pilot licence before his driving licence.[2] He was educated at
iWestfields Sports High School.
i
iUsman Khawaja announced his engagement on 14 December 2016 on his Facebook
ipage.[3] and subsequently married his wife Rachel on 6 April 2018.[4] Rachel
iKhawaja (née McLellan) converted to Islam prior to their wedding.[4] Khawaja
iis a dual Australian and Pakistani citizen.[5]
i
i===== Domestic and T20 career =====
i
iA left-handed top order batsman, Khawaja was awarded Player of the Australian
iUnder-19 Championship in 2005 and also played for Australia in the 2006 U-19
iCricket World Cup in Sri Lanka as an opening batsman.
i
iHe made his first-class debut for the New South Wales Blues in 2008.[6] In
ithe same year, he hit consecutive double centuries for the NSW Second XI—a
ifeat never before achieved by a NSW player.[7] On 22 June 2010 it was
iannounced by Cricket Australia that Usman Khawaja would be a part of the
iAustralian touring squad to play Pakistan in a two Test series in England.
i
iFrom 2011 to February 2022,[8] Khawaja played for the Sydney Thunder in the
iBig Bash League. In BBL05, he was the second highest run scorer, scoring 345
iruns at an average of 172.50.
i
iKhawaja signed a contract to play for county side Derbyshire in the 2011
iEnglish domestic season.[9] He played in four County Championship matches,
iaveraging 39.87 with the bat and scoring a century (135) against
iKent.[10][11]
iAfter his county stint, he made five further Test appearances in 2011,
iscoring
ione half-century (65) against South Africa. He was dropped from Australia's
iTest team after the home series against New Zealand, making way for Shaun
iMarsh upon Marsh's return from injury.[12]
i
iLancashire signed Khawaja as an overseas player for the 2014 county season
ifor all formats. Khawaja scored 86 runs on his debut against Durham but in
ivain as Lancashire lost by 27 runs.
i
iHe plays club cricket for Valley District Cricket Club in Brisbane.
i
iIn August 2015, Khawaja was appointed as captain of the Queensland cricket
iteam, replacing previous captain James Hopes.[13]
i
iIn April 2018, he was signed by Glamorgan County Cricket Club to play in the
i2018 Vitality Blast tournament in England.[14] In April 2021, he was signed
iby
iIslamabad United to play the rescheduled matches in the 2021 Pakistan Super
iLeague.[15]
i
iIn February 2022, Khawaja opted out of his contract with the Sydney Thunder,
iciting "family reasons".[8]
i
i===== International career =====
i
iKhawaja was selected as part of the 17-man Australian squad for the 2010–11
iAshes series. During the third Test, Ricky Ponting fractured his finger and
iKhawaja was named as a stand-by if Ponting could not recover in time. He was
isubsequently selected in the Australian cricket team to play in the fifth
iTest
iagainst England in Sydney on 3 January 2011.[16][17] On 3 January 2011,
iKhawaja became the 419th Australian to be presented with an Australian
iCricket
iTest baggy green cap. Khawaja became the first Muslim and first
iPakistani-born
iAustralian player to play Test cricket for Australia,[18][19] and only the
iseventh foreign-born cricketer to do so in the last 80 years.[20]
i
iBefore the third Test against India in March 2013, Australia suspended
iKhawaja, along with James Pattinson, Shane Watson and Mitchell Johnson
ifollowing a breach of discipline.[21] Michael Clarke, the captain, revealed
ithat the step had been taken as a result of repeated infractions which led to
iWatson flying back home and contemplating Test retirement.[22] Some former
iplayers reacted with astonishment at the decision taken by the team
imanagement.[23] Khawaja made his Test return in the second Test of the 2013
iAshes series, replacing Ed Cowan.
i
iIn the first Test against New Zealand on 5 November 2015; his first Test in
imore than two years, he scored his maiden Test century, scoring 174 runs with
i16 fours and 2 sixes. He made this return in his tenth Test in the coveted
inumber 3 position, helping Australia to an emphatic victory.[24]
i
iHe made his Twenty20 International debut for Australia against India on 31
iJanuary 2016.[25]
i
iDuring the 2015–16 season, Khawaja was in spectacular form for Australia and
ihis domestic T20 franchise the Sydney Thunder, with many pundits hailing his
irenaissance as a batsman since being dropped from the Australian team in 2013
iand recovering from an injury in 2015. He also switched to using Kookaburra
iequipment.[26]
i
iAdditionally, Khawaja set a record for becoming the first ever batsman to
iscore a Test century in an innings of a Day-Night Test match on home soil and
istill has the record for the second highest individual score in a Day-Night
iTest innings.[citation needed]
i
iKhawaja played his first Test match against the country of his birth,
iPakistan, on 15 December 2016 at the Gabba. When asked about the significance
iof the match, he described a moment of confusion outside the change rooms:
i
iFunnily enough I was waiting downstairs and I needed the change room locker
ito be opened for us and I was just waiting and the Queensland Cricket lady
icame down. She was like 'Oh, you need the locker rooms open?' I went 'yes
iplease' and she started walking to the Pakistani change room. I was like,
i'No,
iI'm that way, thank you'.[27]
i
iFunnily enough I was waiting downstairs and I needed the change room locker
ito be opened for us and I was just waiting and the Queensland Cricket lady
icame down. She was like 'Oh, you need the locker rooms open?' I went 'yes
iplease' and she started walking to the Pakistani change room. I was like,
i'No,
iI'm that way, thank you'.[27]
i
iIn January 2017, Khawaja dabbed in celebration of his half-century scored in
ia Test match against Pakistan in Sydney. His move received mixed reactions,
iwith some praising it, while others accused him of disrespecting his
iopponents.[28]
i
iIn April 2018, he was awarded a national contract by Cricket Australia for
ithe 2018–19 season.[29][30] He played a match saving innings against Pakistan
iin the first Test in 2018 at Dubai.
i
iIn April 2019, he was named in Australia's squad for the 2019 Cricket World
iCup.[31][32] In Australia's final group-stage match, against South Africa,
iKhawaja picked up a hamstring injury, ruling him out of the rest of the
itournament. Matthew Wade was named as cover for him.[33]
i
iIn July 2019, he was named in Australia's squad for the 2019 Ashes series in
iEngland.[34][35] In the series, he returned the scores of 13, 40, 36, 2, 8
iand
i23, failing to convince.[36] Therefore, for the fourth Ashes Test, Steve
iSmith
ireplaced Khawaja after returning from concussion, while Marnus Labuschagne
iretained his place in the side.[37]
i
iOn 16 July 2020, Khawaja was named in a 26-man preliminary squad of players
ito begin training ahead of a possible tour to England following the COVID-19
ipandemic.[38][39] He was not included in the final squad for the tour.
i
iIn January 2022, Khawaja made a comeback to international cricket after a
ilong hiatus, in the 4th Ashes Test at SCG; and made twin centuries in the
imatch, posting scores of 137 and 101* respectively.[40]
i
iKhawaja was then selected for the Australian tour of Pakistan. He was the
ihighest run scorer in the series scoring 496 runs at an average of 165.33, a
iperformance which earned him player of the series.[41] He scored 97 runs in
ithe first innings of the first test. He then scored 160 runs in the first
iinnings of the second test and 44* in the second innings. In the first
iinnings
iof the third test, he scored 91 followed by 104* in the second innings,
ihelping Australia win the final match of the series and as such the series as
ia whole.[42]
i
iIn January 2023, in the third Test against South Africa, he completed his
i4000 Test runs,[43] and struck his career-best 195 runs.[44] Khawaja capped
ioff his return to international cricket by picking up the Shane Warne Test
iPlayer of the Year at the Allan Border Medal ceremony, ahead of Travis Head
iand Steve Smith. Khawaja was also awarded the Community Impact Award at the
isame event.[45]
i
iKhawaja has scored 14 centuries in Test matches and two in One Day
iInternationals. His highest Test score of 195* came against South Africa at
iSydney Cricket Ground, Sydney in January 2023 and his highest ODI score of
i104
icame against India at JSCA International Stadium, Ranchi in March 2019. He
ithrew his bat in the air when he scored his 15th test century, and first in
iEngland, during the first 2023 Ashes test at Edgbaston.
