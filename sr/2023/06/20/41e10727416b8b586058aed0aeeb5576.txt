i
i===== Club career =====
i
iBorn in Madrid,[5] Rodri joined Atlético Madrid's youth setup in 2007 aged
i11, from CF Rayo Majadahonda.[6] Released in 2013 due to a "lack of physical
istrength", he subsequently signed with Villarreal CF.[7][8]
i
iOn 7 February 2015, while still a junior, Rodri made his senior debut for the
ireserves, coming on as a late substitute in a 3–1 away win against RCD
iEspanyol B in the Segunda División B.[9] He was handed his first start 15
idays
ilater, in a 2–0 victory at Real Zaragoza B.[10]
i
iRodri made his first-team debut on 17 December 2015, starting in a 2–0 home
iwin against SD Huesca for that season's Copa del Rey.[11] His first La Liga
iappearance was on 17 April 2016, when he came on as a second-half substitute
ifor Denis Suárez in a 2–1 away loss to Rayo Vallecano.[12]
i
iOn 4 December 2017, having already established himself as a regular, Rodri
irenewed his contract until 2022.[13] He scored his first goal in the Spanish
itop level on 18 February 2018, the opener in a 1–1 away draw against RCD
iEspanyol.[14]
i
iOn 24 May 2018, Rodri returned to Atlético after the club reached an
iagreement with Villarreal for his transfer. He signed a five-year contract
iwith the Madrid side,[15] for a fee in the region of €20 million plus 5
imillion in variables.[16] He made his debut on 15 August in the 2018 UEFA
iSuper Cup in Tallinn, playing the first 71 minutes of a 4–2 extra-time win
iover city rivals Real Madrid.[17]
i
iOn 3 July 2019, Manchester City met the terms of Rodri's £62.6 million
irelease clause, enabling him to buy out the remainder of his contract with
iAtlético and leave the club. The transfer was a new record transfer fee paid
iby Manchester City.[18][19] He signed a five-year contract.[20]
i
iRodri made his debut in the 2019 FA Community Shield on 4 August at Wembley
iStadium, playing the full 90 minutes as City won on penalties against
iLiverpool after a 1–1 draw.[21] He made his Premier League debut against West
iHam United six days later in a 5–0 away win,[22] and on 14 September he
iscored
ihis first goal in a 3–2 away defeat against Norwich City.[23]
i
iIt was announced in October 2019 that he would be out for a month due to a
ihamstring injury.[24] On 1 March 2020, City won the EFL Cup at Wembley
iStadium
ifor the third consecutive time, beating Aston Villa 2–1 in the final. Rodri
iheaded in City's second goal from a corner, which ultimately turned out to be
ithe winner.[25]
i
iOn 13 February 2021, Rodri scored City's first goal from a penalty in a 3–0
ihome win over Tottenham Hotspur.[26] Over the course of the 2021–22 domestic
icampaign, Rodri had the highest pass completion rate of any midfielder in the
iPremier League, with 91.8% successful passes per 90 mins, and had proved to
ibe
iintegral to City's title win.[27]
i
iOn 12 July 2022, Rodri agreed to extend his contract with Manchester City
iuntil 2027.[28] On 11 April 2023, he scored his first Champions League goal
iin
ia 3–0 win over Bayern Munich in the quarter-final first leg at Etihad
iStadium.[29] On 10 June, he scored the only goal in the Champions League
ifinal
iagainst Inter Milan, securing Manchester City's win for their first ever
iChampions League trophy and complete a continental treble.[30] He was named
iman of the match[31] and was selected as the tournament's Player of the
iSeason.[32]
i
i===== International career =====
i
iAfter playing for Spain at under-16, under-19 and under-21 levels, Rodri was
ifirst selected by the full side on 16 March 2018 for two friendlies with
iGermany and Argentina.[33] He made his debut five days later, replacing
iThiago
iAlcântara late in the 1–1 draw against Germany in Düsseldorf.[34]
i
iRodri was included in Luis Enrique's 24-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020[35] and
i2022 FIFA World Cup.[36]
i
i===== Style of play =====
i
iRodri is a physically strong and tall player. His physique helps him to
ifrequently win tackles, challenges on opponent players, as well as aerial
iduels. He has a 73% success rate at tackles on opponent players,[37] and has
iwon 100% of his aerial duels in the 2022–23 season, according to Squawka. He
iaverages a passing accuracy of 91–92%.[37]
i
iIn his Manchester City tenure, he is also known for his long shots leading to
igoals.[citation needed] Despite not being particularly renowned for his pace,
ihe has been credited by pundits for his ability to catch up with much faster
iattackers in midfield.[38][39][40] Many pundits consider him as one of the
ibest current defensive midfielders in world football.[41][42][43]
i
iBesides his regular position of a holding midfielder, he has occasionally
ibeen used as a ball-playing centre back, in particular by national team
imanager Luis Enrique during the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[44]
