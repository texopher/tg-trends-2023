iFlorent Pagny (born 6 November 1961) is a French singer-songwriter, musician
iand actor. He records his work in French, as well as in Italian, Spanish and
iEnglish. His greatest hits include "N'importe quoi", "Savoir aimer" and "Ma
iLiberté de penser"—all three were number one in France. As of 2018, he has
isold more than 6 million singles and 10 million albums, becoming the 17th
ibest-selling artist of all time in France.
i
i===== Early years =====
i
iFlorent Pagny began his artistic career as an actor in popular films and
itelevision dramas. He appeared in La Balance, L'As des as, and A Captain's
iHonor or Fort Saganne.
i
iIn 1987, he wrote his first song titled "N'importe quoi". Pagny's first
ialbum, Merci, was released in 1990. The album's songs, mainly written by
ihimself, began to attract controversy[vague], with the press eventually
iboycotting some of them. This led to a decline in sales, culminating in
ipersonal problems. His follow-up album, Réaliste, was also not as
isuccessful.[citation needed]
i
iJean-Jacques Goldman wrote three songs for Pagny under the pseudonym Sam
iBrewski, and presented to him a new staff. The album Rester vrai marked the
ibeginning of his career as a performer only. Bienvenue chez moi, a
isemi-compilation released in 1995, was a smash success. Pagny also covered
i"Caruso", the hit originally performed by Lucio Dalla.
i
i===== Pagny as a performer =====
i
iHe decided to move to Argentinian Patagonia to flee the French tax
iauthorities and to start a new life with his wife, Azucena, and their
ichildren.[citation needed] Recently, Pagny said he had enrolled his children
iin Miami because he didn't want them to speak Arabic while returning from
ischool. His next album, Savoir aimer, was released in 1997. It was composed
iby
ia number of writers, including Jean-Jacques Goldman, Erick Benzi, Jacques
iVeneruso, Zazie and, Pascal Obispo, who also produced the album. "Savoir
iaimer" turned out to be an immediate success.
i
iIn 1999, Pagny released an album of cover versions of his old song,
iRecréation. From "Môme Julie" to "Antisocial", he mixed musical styles and
idabbled with techno arrangements.
i
iPagny then alternated studios and cover albums (at least in part) and
iregularly changed his look. In 2000, he released the album Châtelet Les
iHalles, whose title song was produced by Calogero. He followed that with 2,
ian
ialbum composed of duets released in 2001. In 2003, he returned with Ailleurs
iland, whose first single, "Ma Liberté de penser", was composed by Pascal
iObispo and Lionel Florence and deals with Pagny's problems with the French
itreasury. Finally, in 2004, Pagny released Baryton, an album composed of
iopera
isongs.
i
iIn 2007, Pagny released an album of covers of songs originally composed and
iperformed by Jacques Brel entitled Pagny chante Brel.
