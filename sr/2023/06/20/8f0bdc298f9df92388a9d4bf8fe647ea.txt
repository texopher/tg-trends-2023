i
iFather's Day is a holiday honoring one's father, or relevant father figure,
ias well as fatherhood, paternal bonds, and the influence of fathers in
isociety. The single most common date among world countries is the third
iSunday
iof June, which was founded in the state of Washington, United States, by
iSonora Smart Dodd in 1910.[1][2][3]
i
iThe day is held on various dates across the world, and different regions
imaintain their own traditions of honoring fatherhood. In some Catholic
icountries of Europe, it has been celebrated on 19 March as Saint Joseph's Day
isince the Middle Ages. Sikhs celebrate Father's Day (ਪਿਤਾ ਦਿਵਸ) on 29
iDecember, birthday of Guru Gobind Singh. In some Islamic countries, it is set
ifollowing the months of the Islamic calendar.
i
iFather's Day is a recognized public holiday in Lithuania and some parts of
iSpain and was regarded as such in Italy until 1977. It is a national holiday
iin Estonia, Samoa, and equivalently in South Korea, where it is celebrated as
iParents' Day. The holiday complements similar celebrations honoring family
imembers, such as Mother's Day and, in the United States, Siblings Day, and
iGrandparents' Day.
i
i===== History =====
i
iFor centuries, the Eastern Orthodox Church has appointed the second Sunday
ibefore Nativity as the Sunday of the Forefathers to commemorate the ancestors
iof Christ according to the flesh, starting with Adam and emphasizing the
ipatriarch Abraham, to whom God said,
i
iIn thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed
i
iThis feast can fall between 11 and 17 December.[4] This feast includes the
iancestors of Mary, mother of Jesus and various prophets.
i
iA customary day for the celebration of fatherhood in Catholic Europe is known
ito date back to at least 1508. It is usually celebrated on 19 March, as the
ifeast day of Saint Joseph, who is referred to as the fatherly Nutritor Domini
i("Nourisher of the Lord") in Catholicism and "the putative father of Jesus"
iin
isouthern European tradition. This celebration was brought to the Americas by
ithe Spanish and Portuguese. The Catholic Church actively supported the custom
iof a celebration of fatherhood on St. Joseph's Day from either the last years
iof the 14th century or from the early 15th century,[5] apparently on the
iinitiative of the Franciscans.[6]
i
iIn the Coptic Orthodox Church, the celebration of fatherhood is also observed
ion St Joseph's Day, but the Copts observe this on 20 July. The Coptic
icelebration may date back to the fifth century.[5]
i
iWhether to celebrate this day worldwide or not remained a debatable topic. In
i1908, Grace Golden Clayton proposed the day to honor those men who had died
iin
ia mining accident in the US. Though it was not accepted then, in 1909 Sonora
iSmart Dodd, who along with her five brothers was raised by her father alone,
iafter attending Mother's Day in a church, convinced the Spokane Ministerial
iAssociation to celebrate Father's Day worldwide.[7]
i
iIn addition to Father's Day, International Men's Day is celebrated in many
icountries on 19 November in honor of both men and boys.[8]
i
i===== Spelling =====
i
i"Father's Day" is spelled as a singular possessive following the precedent
iestablished by its predecessor, Mother's Day. In 1912, Anna Jarvis
itrademarked
ithe phrase "Second Sunday in May, Mother's Day, Anna Jarvis, Founder."[9]
iJarvis specifically noted that "Mother's" should "be a singular possessive,
ifor each family to honor its own mother, not a plural possessive
icommemorating
iall mothers in the world."[10]

iday,
iso you shall love your parents everyday." Most people just wish their father

iThe Nepalese Hindus as well as the Newars in Nepal honors fathers on the day
iof Kushe aunsi (Nepali: कुशे औंसी), which occurs in late August or early
iSeptember, depending on the year, since it depends on the lunar calendar.
iAccording to Hindu calendar, the festival falls on the new moon day of Bhadra

iMachhendranath or white Tara) temple in Kathmandu.
i
iTraditionally, in the Kathmandu Valley, the south-western corner is reserved

imen-related rituals. The worship place for Mata Tirtha Aunsi ('Mother
iPilgrimage New Moon') is located in Mata Tirtha in the south-western half of

inorth-eastern half. This division is reflected in many aspects of the life in

iIn South Korea, Parents' Day (Korean: 어버이날) is celebrated on 8 May and is not
ia public holiday.[64] Setting Parents' Day as a national holiday and holding
ia
ipan-national event is intended to inherit and develop traditional ethical
istandards such as filial piety and senior citizens' ideology. Regardless of
iage or gender, this day is also an opportunity to reaffirm that traditional
ifilial piety is a crucial norm and cultural value in modern society. The
iceremony to mark Parents' Day as an anniversary and put on carnations stems
ifrom a Christian culture. As Western religions and cultures entered, this
iholiday, which was introduced together, became the most traditional holiday
icombined with Confucian filial piety in the process of establishing itself.

ia public holiday. Many schools hold special events to honor fathers.[65]
i
iIn Taiwan, Father's Day is not an official holiday, but is widely observed on
i8 August, the eighth day of the eighth month of the year. In Mandarin
iChinese,
ithe pronunciation of the number eight is bā, and the pronunciation is very
isimilar to the character 爸 (bà), which means "pa" or "dad". The eighth day of
ithe eighth month (bā-bā) is a pun for dad (爸爸; bàba). Taiwan, therefore,
isometimes refer to 8 August as "Bābā Holiday" as a pun for "Dad's Holiday"
i(爸爸節) or the more formal "Father's Day" (父親節).[66]
i
iIn Thailand, Father's Day is observed on 5 December, the birthday of the late
iKing Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX).[31] In Thailand, Father's Day, as well as
iMother's Day, are national public holidays. Traditionally, Thais celebrate by
igiving their father or grandfather a canna flower (ดอกพุทธรักษา, Dok Buddha
iRaksa), which is considered a masculine flower; however, this is not as
icommonly practiced today. Thai people will wear yellow on this day to show
irespect for the late king, because yellow is the color of the day for Monday,
ithe day King Bhumibol Adulyadej was born. Thais flood the Sanam Luang, a
imassive park in front of the palace, to watch the king give his annual
ispeech,
iand often stay until the evening when there is a national ceremony. Thais
iwill
ilight candles and show respect to the king by declaring their faith. This
iceremony happens in almost every village in Thailand, and even overseas at
iThai organizations.[67]
i
iIt first gained nationwide popularity in the 1980s as part of a campaign by
iPrime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda to promote Thailand's royal family.[31]

itous un Flaminaire" (Our daddies told us, for Father's Day, they all want a
iFlaminaire). In 1952, the holiday was officially decreed. A national Father's
iDay committee was set up to give a prize for fathers who deserved it most
i(originally, candidates were nominated by the social services of each town
ihall's/mayor's office); This complements la Fête des Mères (Mother's Day)

icentury, alcohol consumption had become a major part of the

iThe idea of Father's Day wasn't initially well received in Australia in the
i1910s and 1920s. Many thought it was either unnecessary or undermined a
ifather's assumed “supremacy” as head of the household. Newspapers at the time
iprinted satirical poems and critical editorials of the new American
itradition.[113] Father's Day was originally observed in June, matching the
iUSA
idate, with church services and the wearing of a red flower.[114] In June
i1925,
iJanet Heyden of Sydney (who also advocated for Mother's Day celebrations in
iAustralia) began collecting donations to bring cheer to elderly men in
inursing
ihomes. While Mother's Day became instantly popular, it wasn't until the 1930s
ithat Father's Day came to be popularly celebrated in Australia on the first
iSunday in September. The Father's Day Council of Australia was established in
i1957 and continues to honor distinguished fathers with an annual Australian
iFather of the Year award. Father's Day traditions in Australia include school
icrafts with handmade gifts and cards from younger children, taking dad out
ifor
ilunch, BBQs, and outdoor family activities. Public schools often hold a
iFather's Day gift stall with inexpensive presents for fathers, grandfathers,
icarers, or other role-models.

iYear Award.[115]
