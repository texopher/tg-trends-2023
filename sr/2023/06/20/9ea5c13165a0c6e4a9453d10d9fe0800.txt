iABUJA, June 19 (Reuters) - Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu made sweeping
ichanges to the defence forces on Monday, forcing out the security chiefs and
ithe head of police less than a month after taking office.
i
iTinubu, who was sworn in on May 29, has made security one of his major
ipriorities and promised reforms to the sector, including recruitment of more
isoldiers and police officers, while paying and equipping them better.
i
iNigeria's military is stretched fighting a long running Islamist insurgency
iin the northeast and banditry and kidnappings for ransom in the northwest as
iinsecurity has spread to most parts of the country.
i
iIt is not unusual for a new Nigerian president to send security chiefs into
iearly retirement upon taking office, as Tinubu did on Monday.
i
iHe picked Nuhu Ribadu, a former senior police officer and ex-head of the
icountry's economic and financial crimes agency, as his National Security
iAdviser.
i
iMajor General Christopher Musa, who until last year was leading the army's
ifight against the insurgency, takes over as the new Chief of Defence Staff
ifrom Lucky Irabor.
i
iMusa takes over leadership of the military in the aftermath of a Reuters
ireport last year that the Nigerian Army ran a secret and illegal abortion
iprogramme targeting women and girls who had been kidnapped and raped by
iIslamist militants.
i
iMusa denied the programme ever existed and said Reuters reporting was part of
ia foreign effort to undermine the country's fight against the insurgents.
i
iTinubu also named new commanders for the army, navy and air force as well as
ia new head of the Nigeria Customs Service with immediate effect.
