iAnother day, another dollar, and also: Wordle! As always, we're here with
isome tips and tricks to help you figure out the solution today.
i
iIf you just want to be told the answer, you can scroll to the end of this
iarticle for June 20's Wordle solution revealed. But if you'd rather solve it
iyourself, keep reading for some clues, tips, and strategies to assist you.
i
i===== Where did Wordle come from? =====
i
iOriginally created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner,
iWordle(opens in a new tab) rapidly spread to become an international
iphenomenon, with thousands of people around the globe playing every day.
iAlternate Wordle versions created by fans have even sprung up, including
ibattle royale Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations
ilike
iDordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.
i
iWordle eventually became so popular that it was purchased by the New York
iTimes, and TikTok creators even livestream themselves playing.
i
iNot the day you're after? Here's the Wordle answer for June 19.
i
i===== What's the best Wordle starting word? =====
i
iThe best Wordle starting word is the one that speaks to you. But if you like
ibeing strategic in your approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word
ithat might help you find the solution faster. One tip is to select a word
ithat
iincludes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S,
iT,
iR, or N.
i
i===== What happened to the Wordle archive? =====
i
iThe entire archive of past Wordle puzzles used to be available for anyone to
ienjoy whenever they felt like it. Unfortunately, it has since been taken
idown,
iwith the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York
iTimes.
i
i===== Is Wordle getting harder? =====
i
iIt might feel like Wordle is getting harder, but it actually isn't any more
idifficult than when it first began. You can turn on Wordle's Hard Mode if
iyou're after more of a challenge, though.
i
i===== Why are there two different Wordle answers some days? =====
i
iThough usually Wordle will only accept one correct solution per day,
ioccasionally it will rebel against the norm and deem two different answers
iacceptable. This is due to changes the New York Times made to Wordle after it
iacquired the puzzle game.
i
iThe Times has since added its own updated word list, so this should happen
ieven less frequently than before. To avoid any confusion, it's a good idea to
irefresh your browser before getting stuck into a new puzzle.
i
i===== Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer: =====
i
iIce, ice, baby.
i
i===== Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter? =====
i
iNot today!
i
i===== Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with... =====
i
iToday's Wordle starts with the letter F.
i

i
i===== What's the answer to Wordle today? =====

iGet your last guesses in now, because it's your final chance to solve today's
iWordle before we reveal the solution.
i
iDrumroll please!
i
iThe solution to Wordle #731 is...
i
iFROST.

iDon't feel discouraged if you didn't manage to guess it this time. There will
ibe a new Wordle for you to stretch your brain with tomorrow, and we'll be
