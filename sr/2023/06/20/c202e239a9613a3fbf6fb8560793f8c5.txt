i
iGordon Sargent thought he had sunk a putt on Sunday when the ball popped
iright back out of the hole.
i
iThe 20-year-old‚Äôs par attempt on the 18th hole in the final round of the US
iOpen looked as though it was headed squarely for the center of the cup when
iit
ishockingly bounced out and right back onto the green, provoking bewildered
iand
iangry reactions from players and commentators.
i
iLuke Donald, former World No. 1 and current Ryder Cup champion, asked if
ithere was any way the issue with the hole could be resolved immediately.
i
i‚ÄúThis is unacceptable! Does the @USGA go fix this mid round? This should
inever happen,‚Äù Donald tweeted.
i
iTrevor Immelman, a broadcast analyst and former Masters winner, also
iquestioned the incident, asking if the cup was simply not deep enough on the
i18th hole.
i
iHow does that even happen? üò¶ Just cruel for Gordon Sargent on the 18th. üì∫:

i
iPro golfer Hunter Mahan was similarly stunned, tweeting, ‚ÄúWTF just happened
ito Sargent????? How could that happen?!‚Äù
i
iThe USGA said the issue had to do with the previous player or caddie altering
ithe hole liner, with Ryan Gerard and Mackenzie Hughes having played before
ihim.
i
iWhen removing the flagstick, the group may have dislodged the hole liner,
iwhich the USGA did not have a chance to adjust before Sargent‚Äôs putt.
i
iSargent, a sophomore at Vanderbilt and the 2022 NCAA champion, finished the
itournament at 4-over to earn low amateur honors.
i
i‚ÄúI had like a two-and-a-half footer straight up the hill that hit the back of
ithe hole and just bounced right back to me,‚Äù Sargent told reporters.
i
i‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt seen that happen in a while, but that‚Äôs how it goes sometimes.‚Äù
i
iDespite the odd putt, he said the tournament was a big one for his growth as
ia golfer.
i
i‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of what your goal as an amateur is, just to be the low-am,‚Äô‚Äô
iSargent said.
i
i‚ÄúPlaying in my second major, I wasn‚Äôt as nervous as the first one [the
iMasters]. It just gives you confidence and also kind of shows what you need
ito
iwork on. I know that my good golf, I can compete with the best and just need
ito limit the mistakes a little bit.‚Äô‚Äô
