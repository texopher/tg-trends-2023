i
i===== Indonesia vs Argentina: as it happened =====
i
iArgentina defeat Indonesia in the first clash between the sides at senior
ilevel.
i
iThe only previous meeting between the two countries was at youth level when
ithe South Americans recorded a 5-0 win at the 1979 U-20 World Cup. A certain
iDiego Maradona grabbed a brace that day.
i
iFT: Indonesia 0-2 Argentina
i
iArgentina beat Indonesia with goals from Paredes and Romero either side of
ihalf-time.
i
iAnd the referee blows his whistle for full-time!
i
iIt's all over!
i
iIt's a narrow angle for Garnacho, who hits the target with a low drive, but
iit's kept out and remains 2-0.
i
iGarnacho shoots!
i
iSutaryadi saves with his feet.
i
iIndonesia will be proud of their performance against the world champions.
iThey haven't been humiliated and even had their own chances to score.
i
iThere will be five minutes added on!
i
iGarnacho gets down the left, but Bahar goes sliding in to win the ball off
ithe young winger.
i
iGarnacho then goes in high-footed on Bahar and is very lucky to not see a
iyellow for that challenge.
i
iOFF Ivar Jenner
i
iON Yakob Sayuri
i
iOFF Leandro Paredes
i
iON Guido Rodriguez
i
iOFF Exequiel Palacios ON Thiago Almada
i
iOFF Julian Alvarez ON Giovanni Simeone
i
iScaloni is about to make more changes.
i
iOcampos goes on a mazy run on the right flank but runs out of play. It's a
igoal-kick for the home side.
i
iIndonesia have a free-kick after a foul by Champions League winner Julian
iAlvarez.
i
iArgentina lead 2-0 as we enter the final 10 minutes of the game.
i
iOFF Facundo Valentin Buonanotte
i
iON Lucas Ocampos
i
iThe Sevilla man replaces the young Brighton attacker.
i
iBuonanotte!
i
iThe Brighton man cuts in from the right, but his left-footed strike from 20
iyards out is weak and an easy one for Ernando Ari Sutaryadi.
i
iSeveral 50-50 balls have been contested with flying challenges.
i
iAnd a Mexican wave is going around the stadium now!
i
iIt's become quite fiery - far from a friendly atmosphere - and the noise
iinside the ground has kept both sides on their toes.
i
iGarnacho goes over in the box, although the referee waves play on. There was
inothing in it.
i
iLivewire Garnacho is on for his second appearance in an Argentina shirt.
i
iHe made his debut in the 2-0 win over Australia just four days ago. Although
ithe Manchester United man was born in Madrid, he has decided to play for
iArgentina.
i
iArgentina changes
i
iHere's confirmation of those Argentina changes.
i
iScaloni has decided to give a rest to some of his stars. It has been a long
iseason.
i
iArgentina are about to make a couple of changes.
i
iDespite the second Albiceleste goal, Indonesia have kept going. A throw is
ilaunched into the box, Martinez is way off his line to punch it away.
i
iThe Tottenham man makes no mistake!
i
iRomero gets past his man to head home from the corner.
i
iArgentina lead 2-0!
i
iGOAL!
i
iRomeroooooo!!!
i
iMartinez has been quiet between the sticks but was made work for that one.
iIt's an excellent stop to deny the defender.
i
iBaggott!
i
iHis header is creeping in but Martinez tips it over the bar.
i
iThat was Indonesia's best chance of the game. So close!
i
iThe home fans are well up for this one, creating plenty of noise throughout.
iEven the throw-ins are celebrated! A home goal would send the place wild!
i
iParedes opened the scoring in the first half with a stunning effort from
idistance.
i
iKlok goes short with the corner, and the cross is overhit. Argentina have a
ithrow-in near the corner flag.
i
iThe Argentina bench is full of quality, with the likes of Mac Allister and De
iPaul on it. Garnacho is also likely to make an appearance soon.
i
iIndonesia send a free in from the left. Martinez comes off his line to catch
iit. Just the one goal separates the sides but Argentina dominated in the
ifirst
ihalf.
i
iOFF Muhammad Dimas Drajad
i
iON Dendi Sulistyawan
i
iIndonesia change
i
iOFF Shayne Pattynama
i
iON Pratama Arhan
i
iWe're underway for the second half!
i
iArgentina lead 1-0
i
iThe teams make their way out for the second half.
i
iScaloni's side hold a narrow lead.
i
iHT: Indonesia 0-1 Argentina
i
iSo, Argentina lead at the break thanks to a stunning goal from Leandro
iParedes. It could be more but the home side are only losing 1-0 against the
iworld champions.
i
iThere's the whistle for half-time!
i
iJenner shoots! Martinez saves!
i
iThe Villa keeper keeps Indonesia out.
i
iThere will be four minutes added on!
i
iALVAREZ!
i
iIt's almost 2-0!
i
iLo Celso cuts the backline open with a super pass... Alvarez takes a touch to
ithe right and fires a shot into the side netting.
i
iRafael Struick is fouled. Indonesia have a free.
i
iBrighton star Buonanotte cuts in from the right. His low drive goes wide of
ithe near post. It opened up nicely for him, but he fails to execute.
i
iWell, it has been coming. Paredes picks it up 40 yards from goal and
iunleashes a wonderful effort that flies into the top corner.
i
iIt's a brilliant strike to break the deadlock.
i
iGooooooooaaalll!!!
i
iPAREDES!!!
i
iWhat a strike!
i
iIndonesia win a corner on the left. The home crowd celebrate like it's a
igoal.
i
iThe ball is sent to the front post. Romero, all alone, heads it well clear.
i0-0
i
iDibu Martínez hasn't had a touch. He'll be wondering why he didn't take his
iyerba mate.
i
iAlvarez gets up highest to win the header from Paredes' corner, but the City
iforward can't keep it down and it sails over.
i
iLo Celso goes around the keeper... he only has to tap it in but Ridho rushes
iback and somehow manages to clear it off the line. That is super defending.
iLo
iCelso can't quite believe it.
i
iArgentina have a free-kick 25 yards from goal. Palacios sends it well over
ithe bar. It's a poor effort.
i
iThe atmosphere lifts as Indonesia get a rare moment in the Argentine box.
iCuti Romero comes out to dispossess Struick and the world champions regain
ipossession.
i
iIndonesia, not for the first time, clear an Argentine corner. Scaloni orders
iinstructions. The goal is coming, it's just a question of when. But the home
iteam will be delighted with their defending thus far.
i
iParedes, in acres of space, goes for the diagonal to Nicolas Gonzalez. It's
ioverhit, but the latter applauds the ball played over the top.
i
iArgentina are playing Indonesia for the first time at senior level today.
i
iThe only previous meeting between the two teams was at youth level: a 5-0 win
ifor La Albiceleste at the 1979 U-20 World Cup, with two goals from Diego
iMaradona and three from Ramón Díaz.
i
iSutaryadi with the save!
i
iNicolas Gonzalez has a go from the edge of the area but the Indonesia
inetminder gets down to his right to keep the effort out.
i
iAll the danger is coming down Argentina's left. 0-0
i
iArgentina win their fourth corner of the game. Lo Celso heads over to
ideliver.
i
iHis cross is a low one and the home side manage to clear it at the near post.
i
iIndonesia are camped in their own half, but Argentina have yet to break the
ideadlock. The home fans are in good spirits despite the early onslaught.
i
iIt's all Argentina. Nicolas Gonzalez is played in on the left, but Sutaryadi
icomes out to claim the cross. 0-0
i
iPalacios plays it wide to Molina on the right. The Atlético Madrid man curls
ia cross into the box. Sutaryadi punches it out.
i
iPezzella heads the resulting Lo Celso corner over the bar. He scored against
iAustralia but is unable to convert this time.
i
iParedes sends his corner from the left to the back post. Pezzella goes for an
iaudacious overhead kick but fails to connect properly and it goes out for a
igoal-kick.
i
iJulian Alvarez leads the line for La Albiceleste today. What a season he has
ihad, by the way.
i
iThe former River man has won the World Cup, Champions League, Premier League,
iand FA Cup!
i
iArgentina go short from the corner but are unable to break through the home
idefence.
i
iLo Celso fires a low cross across the box from the left-hand side. It's
ikicked out for a corner.
i
iArgentina have had all the early possession as you might expect. Scaloni has
imade changes but this is still a team full of quality.
i
iArgentina are playing from left to right in the first half. The world
ichampions beat Australia just four days ago. That was with Messi. Today, they
itake on Indonesia, who are ranked 149th in the world.
i
iArgentina get us underway!
i
iIndonesia are playing in their all-red kit, while La Albiceleste are in their
ifamous blue and white.
i
iAnd it's time for the national anthems!
i
iWith Leo Messi already on holiday, centre-back Germán Pezzella captains
iArgentina today.
i
iThe Betis player scored a glancing header in the 2-0 victory over Australia
iin Beijing on 15 June.
i
iFacundo Buonanotte makes his debut for Argentina. The Brighton player is just
i18 years old and has a big future in the game.
i
iAlejandro Garnacho starts, once again, on the bench.

i
iWhen did Messi last miss a match with La Albiceleste?

i(27/1/22) and Colombia (1/2/22).
i
iMessi was out of action for a month after contracting covid-19 and his

inow.
i
iWho will replace Messi?
i
iAhead of the game, Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni spoke in a press
iconference where he gave some clues as to how his team will play on Monday.
i
iBut regarding Messi's replacement, Scaloni did not reveal too much. "Who will
ireplace him? No one. No one can play like Messi. But we'll try to get the
iteam
ito play in the same way, knowing that it's impossible to replace the player,
ibut that the team is capable of doing just as well with the same attitude,"
ihe
isaid.
i
iAlejandro Garnacho made his long-awaited debut against Australia and the
iManchester United attacker will likely get some more game time today.

i
iDibu Martínez; Nahuel Molina, Germán Pezzella, Cuti Romero, Nico Tagliafico;
iDe Paul, Leandro Paredes, Giovani Lo Celso; Lucas Ocampos, Julián Álvarez,
iAlejandro Garnacho.

iArhan; Marc Klok, Ricky Kambuaya; Yakob Sayuri, Dendi Sulistyawan, Stefano
