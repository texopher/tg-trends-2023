i
iCristiano Ronaldo may be in line for an uncomfortable reunion with old foe
iSaul Niguez.
i
iAtletico Madrid ace Saul, who spent the 2021-22 season on loan at Chelsea, is
ithe latest European star to be linked with a move to Al Nassr. If the
i28-year-old agrees to the switch, he would become a team-mate of Ronaldo's
iafter a number of years as his rival.
i
iRonaldo and Saul went toe-to-toe on a number of occasions domestically and
icontinentally, most notably when Ronaldo's Real Madrid beat Saul's Atleti in
ithe 2016 Champions League final A few months later, though, the Spanish
imidfielder made his thoughts about his rival clear.
i
i"Luka Modric is Real Madrid's best player," Saul said ahead of a Madrid derby
iin November 2016. "We know that they have important players in attack, but
iModric moves the team forward."
i
iThe comments came despite Ronaldo having scored 51 goals in all competitions
ithe previous season, including the winning penalty in the Champions League
ifinal penalty shoot-out. Saul also put away his spot-kick, but it wasn't
ienough to prevent a second final defeat in three years against Los Blancos.
i
iSpain international Saul has failed to hit the same heights of late, winning
ihis last senior cap in 2019. He returned to play a part for Atleti last term
iafter his year in London, but Marca reports that there is already an offer on
ithe table from Al Nassr.
i
iWould Saul work well with Ronaldo? Have your say in the comments section

i
iThe same report claims Al Nassr and Atletico are yet to reach an agreement
iover a transfer fee. Saul's current deal in the Spanish capital runs until
i2026.
i
iIf a deal goes through, it would continue the influx of European-based
iplayers to the Saudi Pro League. Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema is the
ihighest-profile summer arrival, while Ruben Neves is on his way to Al-Hilal
iand Chelsea playmaker Hakim Ziyech has spoken with Al Nassr.
i
iDespite the high number of moves, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin remains
ipublicly unworried. The Slovenian was asked about the matter in the lead-up
ito
iSunday's UEFA Nations League final, and suggested Saudi football's priorities
ishould lie elsewhere.
i
i"I think that it's mainly a mistake for Saudi Arabian football," Ceferin told
iNOS (via ESPN). "Why is that a problem for them? Because they should invest
iin
iacademies, they should bring coaches, and they should develop their own
iplayers.
i
i"The system of buying the players that almost ended their career is not the
isystem that develops football. it was a similar mistake in China when they
iall
ibrought players who are at the end of their career."
