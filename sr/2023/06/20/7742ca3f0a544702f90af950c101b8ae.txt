iThis article was originally published in 2020. It was updated in 2023.
i
iJuneteenth, an annual commemoration of the end of slavery in the United
iStates after the Civil War, has been celebrated by African Americans since
ithe
ilate 1800s.
i
iPresident Biden signed legislation in 2021 that made Juneteenth, which falls
ion June 19, a federal holiday, after interest in the day was renewed during
ithe summer of 2020 and the nationwide protests that followed the police
ikillings of Black Americans including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.
i
iThere has been a noticeable increase in Juneteenth celebrations across the
iUnited States over the past few years.
i
iHere’s a brief guide to Juneteenth.
i
i===== How did Juneteenth begin? =====
i
iOn June 19, 1865, about two months after the Confederate general Robert E.
iLee surrendered at Appomattox, Va., Gordon Granger, a Union general, arrived
iin Galveston, Texas, to inform enslaved African Americans of their freedom
iand
ithat the Civil War had ended. General Granger’s announcement put into effect
ithe Emancipation Proclamation, which had been issued nearly two and a half
iyears earlier, on Jan. 1, 1863, by President Abraham Lincoln.
i
iThe holiday is also called “Juneteenth Independence Day,” “Freedom Day” or
i“Emancipation Day.”
i
i===== How is it celebrated? =====
i
iEarly celebrations involved prayer and family gatherings, and later included
iannual pilgrimages to Galveston by former enslaved people and their families,
iaccording to Juneteenth.com.
i
iIn 1872, a group of African American ministers and businessmen in Houston
ipurchased 10 acres of land and created Emancipation Park which was intended
ito
ihold the city’s annual Juneteenth celebration.
i
iToday, while some celebrations take place among families in backyards where
ifood is an integral element, some cities, like Atlanta and Washington, hold
ilarger events, including parades and festivals with residents, local
ibusinesses and more.
i
iWhile celebrations in 2020 and 2021 were largely subdued by the coronavirus
ipandemic, some cities ramped up their plans last year and plan to have bigger
icelebrations this year.
i
iGalveston has remained a busy site for Juneteenth events over the years, said
iDouglas Matthews, who has helped coordinate them for more than two decades.
i
iAfter dedicating a 5,000-square-foot mural in 2021, in 2023 Galveston will
icelebrate the holiday with a banquet, a scholarship ball and a festival.
iOrganizers in Atlanta will hold a parade and music festival at Centennial
iOlympic Park, and similar events are scheduled in Brooklyn, Los Angeles,
iPhiladelphia and Tulsa, Okla.
i
i===== The path to a national holiday. =====
i
iIn 1980, Texas became the first state to designate Juneteenth as a holiday.
iAll 50 states and the District of Columbia now recognize the day in some
iform.
i
iIn the wake of the nationwide protests against police brutality in 2020, the
ipush for federal recognition of Juneteenth gained new momentum, and Congress
iquickly pushed through legislation in the summer of 2021.
i
iIn the House, the measure passed by a vote of 415 to 14, with all of the
iopposition coming from Republicans, some of whom argued that calling the new
iholiday Juneteenth Independence Day, echoing July 4, would create confusion
iand force Americans to choose a celebration of freedom based on their race.
i
iOn June 17, 2021, President Biden signed the bill into law, making Juneteenth
ithe 11th holiday recognized by the federal government. At a White House
iceremony, Mr. Biden singled out Opal Lee, an activist who at the age of 89
iwalked from her home in Fort Worth to Washington, D.C., and called her “a
igrandmother of the movement to make Juneteenth a federal holiday.”
i
iThe law went into effect immediately, and the first federal Juneteenth
iholiday was celebrated the next day. (The holiday was observed on June 18, as
iJune 19 fell on a Saturday.)

i===== Biden Signs Juneteenth Holiday Into Law =====
i
i“Throughout history, Juneteenth has been known by many names: Jubilee Day,
iFreedom Day, Liberation Day, Emancipation Day, and today, a national holiday.
i[applause] When we establish a national holiday, it makes an important
istatement. National holidays are something important. These are days when we
ias a nation have decided to stop and take stock, and often to acknowledge our
ihistory.” “Juneteenth marks both a long, hard night of slavery, of
isubjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come. This is a day of
iprofound, in my view, profound weight and profound power. A day in which we
iremember the moral stain, the terrible toll that slavery took on the country
iand continues to take. What I’ve long called America’s original sin. At the
isame time, I also remember the extraordinary capacity to heal and hope. And
ito
iemerge from those painful moments and a bitter, bitter version of ourselves.
iThank you, man.” “Thank you.” “All right.” [applause]
i
i===== Why has Juneteenth become so important? =====
i
iFollowing the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died in
ithe custody of the Minneapolis Police in May 2020, thousands of people around
ithe United States poured onto the streets in protest. Mr. Floyd’s name, as
iwell as the names of Ms. Taylor, Mr. Arbery, David McAtee and others, became
ia
irallying cry for change across the country, effectively re-energizing the
iBlack Lives Matter movement.
i
iThat change came in waves. In Minneapolis, officials banned the use of
ichokeholds and strangleholds by the police, and said officers must intervene
iand report any use of unauthorized force.
i
iDemocrats in Congress unveiled sweeping legislation targeting misconduct and
iracial discrimination by the police. The bill was the most expansive
iintervention into policing that lawmakers have proposed in recent memory.
i
iCompanies across the business spectrum voiced support for the Black Lives
iMatter movement and either suspended or fired employees who mocked Mr.
iFloyd’s
ideath or made racist remarks.
i
iIn April 2021, Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was found
iguilty of two counts of murder in the death of Mr. Floyd. But two years on,
imany of the city’s residents say that genuine change has been slow.
i
iMark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies scholar at Duke University,
isaid there are some comparisons between the end of the Civil War to the
iunrest
ithat swept the country, adding that the moment felt like a “rupture.”
i
i“The stakes are a little different,” Mr. Neal said.
i
i“I think Juneteenth feels a little different now,” he said. “It’s an
iopportunity for folks to kind of catch their breath about what has been this
iincredible pace of change and shifting that we’ve seen.”

ithis article misstated the year the photo was taken. The parade pictured was
iin 2018, not last year.

i
iAn earlier version of this article misstated the location of Robert E. Lee’s
isurrender to Ulysses S. Grant. It was at Appomattox Court House, Va., not
iAppomattox.
i
iJune 20, 2022
i
iAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount of time between the
iEmancipation Proclamation and Gen. Gordon Granger’s arrival in Galveston,
iTexas, where he informed enslaved African Americans of their freedom. It was
inearly — not more than — two and a half years.
