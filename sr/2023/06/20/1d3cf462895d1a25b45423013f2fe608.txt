iA young boy walks past a painting depicting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during
ia Juneteenth celebration in Los Angeles in 2020. Juneteenth marks the day in
i1865 when federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, to take control of the
istate and ensure all enslaved people be freed, more than two years after the
iEmancipation Proclamation.
i
iAmericans have been celebrating Juneteenth this weekend, the third year since
ithe holiday was given federal status by President Biden in 2021.
i
iThe date commemorates the fall of slavery in Galveston, Texas, two years
iafter the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863 to free enslaved Black
ipeople held in the Confederacy.
i
iNews of Union troops' victory over the Confederates spread slowly across the
iSouth, eventually reaching the shores of Galveston in 1865.
i
iRace The new Juneteenth federal holiday traces its roots to Galveston, Texas
i
i"We are not celebrating the history of Juneteenth. We are celebrating the
isymbolism of Juneteenth," said Leslie Wilson, professor of history at
iMontclair State University in New Jersey.
i
i"The symbolism of Juneteenth is the transition from slavery to freedom."
i
iCelebrations of the holiday started out regionally in Texas, but as Black
iAmericans spread out across the United States, they brought their traditions
iwith them, including remembrances for one of the final vestiges of chattel
islavery.
i
i"You could say that Juneteenth had a renaissance, largely because when World
iWar II was over and soldiers came home, it was the second Great Migration.
iPeople started traveling from various points in the South to points in the
inorth and points in the West," Wilson said.
i
i"During the civil rights movement in the 1960s, with Civil Rights and also
iwith the Black Power movement, Juneteenth became a symbol of strength as well
ias a symbol of triumph for African-Americans."
i
iWidespread recognition of the holiday was slow moving. For years, it was a
irelatively obscure holiday celebrated among Black people with little
iacknowledgment or understanding from outside cultures and communities.

i
iRace Four enduring myths about Juneteenth are not based on facts
i
i"I'm sure there's a ton I'm totally unaware of on African-American history in
ithe U.S.," said Alex Markle.
i
iMarkle and his fiancée were visiting the National Mall in Washington, D.C.
iduring the long holiday weekend and said it wasn't until he was in his
iforties
ithat he learned about Black history events like Juneteenth, Black Wall Street
iand the Tulsa race massacre.
i
i"That was kind of shocking that like a big piece of American history was
isomething that I had never learned about and was unaware of that much of my
ilife."
i
iMarkle's experience is not unique.
i
iIn 2021, when the holiday gained federal recognition, just 37 percent of
iAmerican adults said they knew at least something about Juneteenth, according
ito polling by Gallup.
i
iJust a year later, that number would spike to nearly 60 percent.
i
iAs the holiday has grown in popularity, many Black people have celebrated the
iidea that African-American history would be more widely recognized as part of
ithe fabric of the United States.

iJuneteenth Slavery Didn't End On Juneteenth. What You Should Know About This
iImportant Day
i
i"As a Black person, it means a lot to me to celebrate everybody who was free
ibecause it's like so many people don't know," said Precious Williams, a
iDallas
inative who was visiting D.C. over the holiday weekend.
i
i"We celebrate everything in America, you know. So those Black holidays, it's
ilike everybody should know about Juneteenth because it's a part of our
ihistory."
i
iBut there are also concerns that corporate money-grabs taking advantage of
ithe day could potentially weaken the gravity of such a historic event.
i
i"The significance of it becoming an official holiday is really the fact that
iit raised awareness of Juneteenth beyond communities that had [already] been
icommemorating Juneteenth. Beyond that, it seems that the significance,
iunfortunately, also brings with it some commodification of that day and sort
iof commercialization of that day as well," said Amara Enyia, a public policy
iexpert in Chicago.
i
iJuneteenth Companies are selling Juneteenth branded products. Here's why
ithat's a big problem
i
iJust last year, big-box retailers like Walmart came under fire for a spread
iof Juneteenth-themed products deemed tasteless and appropriative by many.
i
iAnd politically, the holiday has been weaponized by some Republicans as part
iof an ongoing culture war that claims truthful acknowledgments of race and
iracism are a ploy to demonize white Americans.
i
iDespite these controversies, for many Monday is an opportunity to reflect on
iAmerica and its history, as well as consider what the future might hold.
i
i"Juneteenth celebrations are a chance for this country, for the United States
ito rethink not only its origins, but the relationship of everybody who lives
iin this country to each other," said Greg Carr, associate professor of
iAfricana Studies at Howard University.
i
i"In many ways, Juneteenth symbolically becomes a litmus test for the
ipossibilities of this country."
