i
iThe CONMEBOL Libertadores, also known as the Copa Libertadores de América
i(Portuguese: Copa/Taça Libertadores da América), is an annual international
iclub football competition organized by CONMEBOL since 1960. It is the highest
ilevel of competition in South American club football. The tournament is named
iafter the Libertadores (Spanish and Portuguese for liberators), the leaders
iof
ithe Latin American wars of independence,[1] so a literal translation of its
iformer name into English is "America's Liberators Cup".
i
iThe competition has had several formats over its lifetime. Initially, only
ithe champions of the South American leagues participated. In 1966, the
irunners-up of the South American leagues began to join. In 1998, Mexican
iteams
iwere invited to compete and contested regularly from 2000 until 2016. In 2000
ithe tournament was expanded from 20 to 32 teams. Today at least four clubs
iper
icountry compete in the tournament, with Argentina and Brazil having the most
irepresentatives (six and seven clubs, respectively). A group stage has always
ibeen used but the number of teams per group has varied.[1][2]
i
iIn the present format, the tournament consists of eight stages, with the
ifirst stage taking place in late January. The four surviving teams from the
ifirst three stages join 28 teams in the group stage, which consists of eight
igroups of four teams each. The eight group winners and eight runners-up enter
ithe knockout stages, which end with the final in November. The winner of the
iCopa Libertadores becomes eligible to play in the FIFA Club World Cup and the
iRecopa Sudamericana.[3]
i
iIndependiente of Argentina is the most successful club in the cup's history,
ihaving won the tournament seven times. Argentine clubs have accumulated the
imost victories with 25 wins, while Brazil has the largest number of winning
iteams, with 10 clubs having won the title. The cup has been won by 25 clubs,
i15 of them more than once, and seven clubs have won two years in a row.
i
i===== History =====
i
iThe clashes for the Copa Aldao between the champions of Argentina and Uruguay
ikindled the idea of continental competition in the 1930s.[1] In 1948, the
iSouth American Championship of Champions (Spanish: Campeonato Sudamericano de
iCampeones), the most direct precursor to the Copa Libertadores, was played
iand
iorganized by the Chilean club Colo-Colo after years of planning and
iorganization.[1] Held in Santiago, it brought together the champions of each
ination's top national leagues.[1] The tournament was won by Vasco da Gama of
iBrazil.[1][4][5] The 1948 South American tournament began, in continent-wide
ireach, the "champions cup" model, resulting in the creation of the European
iCup in 1955, as confirmed by Jacques Ferran (one of the "founding fathers" of
ithe European Cup), in a 2015 interview with a Brazilian TV sports
iprogramme.[6]
i
iIn 1958, the basis and format of the competition were created by Peñarol's
iboard leaders. On October 8, 1958, João Havelange announced, at a UEFA
imeeting
ihe attended as an invitee, the creation of Copa de Campeones de America
i(American Champions Cup, renamed in 1965 as Copa Libertadores), as a South
iAmerican equivalent of the European Cup, so that the champion clubs of both
icontinental confederations could decide "the best club team of the world" in
ithe Intercontinental Cup.[7][8] On March 5, 1959, at the 24th South American
iCongress held in Buenos Aires, the competition was ratified by the
iInternational Affairs Committee. In 1965, it was named in honor of the heroes
iof South American liberation, such as Simón Bolívar, José de San Martín,
iPedro
iI, Bernardo O'Higgins, and José Gervasio Artigas, among others.[1]
i
i===== Format =====
i
iMost teams qualify for the Copa Libertadores by winning half-year tournaments
icalled the Apertura and Clausura tournaments or by finishing among the top
iteams in their championship.[3] The countries that use this format are
iBolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.[3] Peru
iand
iEcuador have developed new formats for qualification to the Copa Libertadores
iinvolving several stages.[3] Argentina, Brazil and Chile are the only South
iAmerican leagues to use a European league format instead of the Apertura and
iClausura format.[3] However, one berth for the Copa Libertadores can be won
iby
iwinning the domestic cups in these countries.[3]
i
iPeru, Uruguay and Mexico formerly used a second tournament to decide
iqualification for the Libertadores (the "Liguilla Pre-Libertadores" between
i1992 and 1997, the "Liguilla Pre-Libertadores de América" from 1974 to 2009,
iand the InterLiga from 2004 to 2010, respectively).[2][3] Argentina used an
ianalogous method only once in 1992. Since 2011, the winner of the Copa
iSudamericana has qualified automatically for the following Copa
iLibertadores.[3][9]
i
iFor the 2019 edition, the different stages of the competition were contested
iby the following teams:[3]
i
iBolivia
i
iEcuador
i
iParaguay
i
iPeru
i
iUruguay
i
iVenezuela
i
iArgentina
i
iBolivia
i
iBrazil
i

i

i
iBolivia
i
iBrazil
i
iChile
i
iColombia
i
iEcuador
i
iParaguay
i
iPeru
i
iUruguay
i
iVenezuela
i
iThe winners of the previous season's Copa Libertadores are given an
iadditional entry to the group stage if they do not qualify for the tournament
ithrough their domestic performance; however, if the title holders qualify for
ithe tournament through their domestic performance, an additional entry is
igranted to the next eligible team, "replacing" the titleholder.
i
iUnlike most other competitions around the world, the Copa Libertadores
ihistorically did not use extra time, or away goals.[3] From 1960 to 1987,
itwo-legged ties were decided on points (teams would be awarded 2 points for a
iwin, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss), without considering goal
idifferences. If both teams were level on points after two legs, a third match
iwould be played at a neutral venue. Goal difference would only come into play
iif the third match was drawn. If the third match did not produce an immediate
iwinner, a penalty shootout was used to determine a winner.[3]
i
iFrom 1988 onwards, two-legged ties were decided on points, followed by goal
idifference, with an immediate penalty shootout if the tie was level on
iaggregate after full-time in the second leg.[3] Starting with the 2005
iseason,
iCONMEBOL began to use the away goals rule.[3] In 2008, the finals became an
iexception to the away goals rule and employed extra time.[3] From 1995
ionwards, the "Three points for a win" standard, a system adopted by FIFA in
i1995 that places additional value on wins, was adopted in CONMEBOL, with
iteams
inow earning 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.
i
iThe current tournament features 47 clubs competing over a six- to eight-month
iperiod. There are three stages: the first, the second and the knockout stage.
i
iThe first stage involves 12 clubs in a series of two-legged knockout ties.[3]
iThe six survivors join 26 clubs in the second stage, in which they are
idivided
iinto eight groups of four.[3] The teams in each group play in a double
iround-robin format, with each team playing home and away games against every
iother team in their group.[3] The top two teams from each group are then
idrawn
iinto the knockout stage, which consists of two-legged knockout ties.[3] From
ithat point, the competition proceeds with two-legged knockout ties to
iquarterfinals, semifinals, and the finals.[3] Between 1960 and 1987 the
iprevious winners did not enter the competition until the semifinal stage,
imaking it much easier to retain the cup.[3]
i
iBetween 1960 and 2004, the winner of the tournament participated in the
inow-defunct Intercontinental Cup or (after 1980) Toyota Cup, a football
icompetition endorsed by UEFA and CONMEBOL, contested against the winners of
ithe European Cup (since renamed the UEFA Champions League)[3] Since 2004, the
iwinner has played in the Club World Cup, an international competition
icontested by the champion clubs from all six continental confederations. It
iis
iorganized by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA),
ithe
isport's global governing body. Because Europe and South America are
iconsidered
ithe strongest centers of the sport, the champions of those continents enter
ithe tournament at the semifinal stage.[3] The winning team also qualifies to
iplay in the Recopa Sudamericana, a two-legged final series against the
iwinners
iof the Copa Sudamericana.[3]
i
i===== Prizes =====
i
iThe tournament shares its name with the trophy, also called the Copa
iLibertadores or simply la Copa, which is awarded to the Copa Libertadores
iwinner. It was designed by goldsmith Alberto de Gasperi, an Italian-born
iimmigrant to Peru, in Camusso Jewelry in Lima at the behest of CONMEBOL.[10]
iThe top of the laurel is made of sterling silver, except for the football
iplayer at the top (which is made of bronze with a silver coating).[11]
i
iThe pedestal, which contains badges from every winner of the competition, is
imade of hardwood plywood. The badges show the season, the full name of the
iwinning club, and the city and nation from which the champions hail. To the
ileft of that information is the club logo. Any club which wins three
iconsecutive tournaments has the right to keep the trophy. Today, the current
itrophy is the third in the history of the competition.
i
iTwo clubs have kept the actual trophy after three consecutive wins:[12]
i
iAs of 2023[update], clubs in the Copa Libertadores receive US$500,000 for
iadvancing into the second stage and US$1,000,000 per home match in the group
iphase, with an additional US$300,000 awarded per match won in that stage.
iThat
iamount is derived from television rights and stadium advertising. The payment
iper home match increases to US$1,250,000 in the round of 16. The prize money
ithen increases as each quarterfinalist receives US$1,700,000, US$2,300,000 is
igiven to each semifinalist, US$7,000,000 is awarded to the runner-up, and the
iwinner earns US$18,000,000.[13]
i
i===== Cultural impact =====
i
iThe Copa Libertadores occupies an important space in South American culture.
iThe folklore, fanfare, and organization of many competitions around the world
iowe its aspects to the Libertadores.
i
iThe Sueño Libertador ("Liberator Dream") is a promotional phrase used by
isports journalism in the context of winning or attempting to win the Copa
iLibertadores.[14] Thus, when a team gets eliminated from the competition, it
iis said that the team has awakened from the liberator dream. The project
inormally starts after the club wins its national league (which grants them
ithe
iright to compete in the following year's Copa Libertadores).
i
iIt is common for clubs to spend large sums of money to win the Copa
iLibertadores. In 1998 for example, Vasco da Gama spent $10 million to win the
icompetition, and in 1998, Palmeiras, managed by Luiz Felipe Scolari, brought
iJúnior Baiano among other players, winning the 1999 Copa Libertadores. The
itournament is highly regarded among its participants. In 2010, players from
iGuadalajara stated that they would rather play in the Copa Libertadores final
ithan appear in a friendly against Spain, then reigning world champions,[15]
iand dispute their national league.[16] Similarly, after their triumph in the
i2010 Copa do Brasil, several Santos players made it known that they wished to
istay at the club and participate in the 2011 Copa Libertadores, despite
ihaving
imultimillion-dollar contracts lined up for them at clubs participating in the
iUEFA Champions League, such as Chelsea of England and Lyon of France.[17]
i
iFormer Boca Juniors goalkeeper Óscar Córdoba has stated that the Copa
iLibertadores was the most prestigious trophy he won in his career (above the
iArgentine league, Intercontinental Cup, etc.)[18]
i
iSince its inception in 1960, the Copa Libertadores had predominantly been won
iby clubs from nations with an Atlantic coast: Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.
iOlimpia of Paraguay became the first team outside of those nations to win the
iCopa Libertadores when they triumphed in 1979.
i
iThe first club from a country with a Pacific coast to reach a final was
iUniversitario of Lima, Peru, who lost in 1972 against Independiente of
iArgentina.[19] The following year, Independiente defeated Colo-Colo of Chile,
ianother Pacific team, creating the myth that the trophy would never go to the
iwest, giving birth to the saying, "La Copa se mira y no se toca" (Spanish:
iThe
iCup is to be seen, not to be touched).[19] Unión Española became the third
iPacific team to reach the final in 1975, although they also lost to
iIndependiente.[19] Atletico Nacional of Medellín, Colombia, won the Copa
iLibertadores in 1989, becoming the first nation with a Pacific coastline to
iwin the tournament.[20] In 1990 and 1998 Barcelona Sporting Club, of Ecuador
ialso made it to the final but lost both finals to Olimpia and CR Vasco da
iGama
irespectively.
i
iOther clubs from nations with Pacific coastlines to have won the competition
iare Colo-Colo of Chile in 1991, Once Caldas of Colombia in 2004, and LDU
iQuito
iof Ecuador in 2008. Atletico Nacional of Colombia earned their second title
iin
i2016. Particular mockery was used from Argentinian teams to Chilean teams for
inever having obtained the Copa Libertadores, so after Colo-Colo's triumph in
i1991 a new phrase saying "la copa se mira y se toca" (Spanish: The Cup is
iseen
iand touched) was implemented in Chile.
i
i===== Ambassador =====
i
iPelé, regarded by many football historians, former players and fans to be the
ibest footballer in the game's history,[21] was appointed ambassador of the
iCopa Libertadores in 2008 by Banco Santander, the competition's main sponsor
iby then.[22][23] The assignment was then renovated as the corporation
iconsidered Pelé "a promoter of the competition with his team Santos FC during
ithe 1960s".[24]
i
iIn 1999, he was voted as the Football Player of the Century by the IFFHS
iInternational Federation of Football History and Statistics. In the same
iyear,
iFrench weekly magazine France-Football consulted their former "Ballon D'Or"
iwinners to elect the Football Player of the Century. Pelé came in first
iplace.[25] In 1999 the International Olympic Committee named Pelé the
i"Athlete
iof the Century".[26]
i
i===== Media coverage =====
i
iThe tournament attracts television audiences beyond South America, Mexico,
iand Spain. Matches are broadcast in over 135 countries, with commentary in
imore than 30 languages, and thus the Copa is often considered one of the most
iwatched sports events on TV;[27] Fox Sports, for example, reaches more than
i25
imillion households in the Americas.[28] Movistar+ broadcasts live Copa
iLibertadores matches in Spain.[29]
i
iAs of January 19, 2019 beIN Sports has obtained the broadcasting rights for
iAustralia, Canada, MENA, New Zealand, and the United States beginning in 2019
ithrough 2022.[30]
i
i===== Sponsorship =====
i
iFrom 1997 to 2017, the competition had a single main sponsor for naming
irights. The first major sponsor was Toyota, who signed a ten-year contract
iwith CONMEBOL in 1997.[31] The second major sponsor was Banco Santander, who
isigned a five-year contract with CONMEBOL in 2008.[32] The third major
isponsor
iwas Bridgestone, who signed a sponsorship deal for naming rights for a period
iof five years from 2013 edition to 2017.[33]
i
iAs of 2023, sponsors of Copa Libertadores are:
i
i===== Match ball =====
i
iNike supplies the official match ball since 2003, as they do for all other
iCONMEBOL competitions.[34][35] As of 2022, the current match ball for the
iCopa
iLibertadores is the Nike Flight.[36]
i
iThe Flight model was introduced in 2020 in replacement of the "Merlin" by the
isame manufacturer. A different version of the Flight had been used during the
i2021 Copa América.[37]
i
i===== Records and statistics =====
i
iThe data below does not include the 1948 South American Championship of
iChampions, as it is not listed by Conmebol either as a Copa Libertadores
iedition or as an official competition. However, at least in the years
i1996/1997, Conmebol entitled equal status to both Copa Libertadores and the
i1948 tournament, in that the 1948 champion club (CR Vasco da Gama) was
iallowed
ito participate in Supercopa Libertadores, a Conmebol official competition
ithat
iallowed participation for former Libertadores champions only (for example,
inot
iadmitting participation for champions of other Conmebol official
icompetitions,
isuch as Copa CONMEBOL).
i
i===== Performances by club =====
i
iBolivia and Venezuela are the only countries never to reach a final. Beyond
ithem, Peru (and Mexico in their invitational period) are the only ones never
ito win a final.
