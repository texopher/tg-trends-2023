i===== Life =====
i
iJeong was born 1966 in Hampyeong County, South Jeolla Province. A Catholic,
ishe graduated from Christian Nursing College in Gwangju. She later worked as
ia
inurse for five years and at the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service
ifor nine years. Her work experience formed the basis for building her
irealistic narratives and story structures for her novels, Shoot Me in the
iHeart (내 심장을 쏴라), and Chilnyeonui bam (7년의 밤 Seven Years of Darkness).[4]
i
iJeong had dreamed of becoming a writer as a child, but could not pursue it
idue to her mother's disapproval. Her uncle was a playwright who had died due
ito poverty in his early 40s, and her mother feared her daughter would meet a
isimilar fate. Jeong is also known for her persistence in becoming a writer.
iShe was rejected by 11 competitions in six years, and pledged to never write
iagain if she was rejected again. She submitted Nae insaeng-ui spring camp (내
i인생의 스프링캠프 My Life's Spring Camp) to the Segye Youth Literature Competition
iand
iwon at age 41.[5]
i
iHer novel Shoot Me in the Heart (내 심장을 쏴라) alludes to her youth. While
iworking as an intensive care nurse in her 20s, her mother died and forced
iJeong to be the family breadwinner. She has said she endured that period of
iher life by holding on to the hope of arriving in a warm and sunny place once
iher difficulty had passed. In the book, Seungmin's dream of freedom and
iimagining Annapurna was also the author's wish. After writing her novel 28,
ishe went to Annapurna, and based on this experience she published the book
iJeong You Jeong’s Himalaya Hwansangbanghwang (정유정의 히말라야 환상방황 Jeong You
iJeong's
iFantastic Wandering in the Himalayas).[6]
i
iTwo of Jeong's novels have been made into films due to their intense
inarratives. Shoot Me in the Heart (내 심장을 쏴라) was made into a film released in
i2015 by director Mun Che-yong and starring Yeo Jin-goo and Lee Min-ki. Seven
iYears of Night (7년의 밤) was produced with Choo Chang-min as director and
istarring Jang Dong-gun and Ryu Seung-ryong.[7] Her recent work The Good Son
i(종의 기원) has also been optioned by a film studio and is expected to be
iproduced
iinto a film.[8]
i
i===== Writing =====
i
iJeong's debut in the 2010s shocked the Korean literary circle.[original
iresearch?] This was because compared to fellow Korean writers that had
idebuted
ithrough new writer's contests or literary journals, who write works by laying
iout human psychology over real sentiments on life, Jeong You Jeong had
iactively drawn genre specific subjects into the narrative in creating a
istory.[original research?]
i
iIn Shoot Me in the Heart (내 심장을 쏴라), Jeong You Jeong satirizes the whole
iKorean society through the setting of a mental hospital, and tells the story
iof two young men attempting to escape. Shoot me in the Heart (내 심장을 쏴라),
iwhich
iwas selected as the winner of the ‘Segye Literature Award’, was supported by
iyounger judges, but was not favorably praised by older judges. Because of
ithis, it's been said that there were two secret voting sessions.[9] Literary
icritic Kim Hwayoung and writer Hwang Sok-yong, the judges at the time, had
isaid that the work had a weakness in that the story was “hard to get through
iin the beginning,’ but also that it “makes one have sincere doubts through
ithe
imetaphor of how life goes round in circles despite constantly dreaming and
iattempting escape”.[10]
i
iJeong's major work Seven Years of Night (7년의 밤) is structured into separate
inarratives of a story seven years ago, when the tragic MV Seryeong incident
ihappened, and another in present day in which a man wandering through life
iand
imarked as a murderer's son receives news of his father's execution. The son
iattempts to solve the incident's mysteries. As the author says she is a fan
iof
iHemingway, Charles Dickens and Stephen King, she uses meticulous descriptions
iand a narrative that stimulates tension.[11] Writer Park Bum Shin has highly
ipraised Jeong You Jeong as having "opened a new horizon for novels through
iliterary sincerity, dynamic narratives, and daring appeals to the reader,"
iand
ithat she is a monster of Korean Literature, an "Amazon."[12]
i
i28 is about the end of the world brought about by a waterborne epidemic,
iwhile The Good Son (종의 기원 ) deals with the origin of evil within people.
