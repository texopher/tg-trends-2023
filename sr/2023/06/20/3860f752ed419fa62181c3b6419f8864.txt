i
i===== Team news & squads =====
i
iMemphis Depay and Matthijs de Ligt miss out through injury.
i
iThat would suggest that Ronald Koeman may deploy Wout Weghorst or Steven
iBergwijn at the tip of the attack after a below-par performance by
iLiverpool's
iCody Gakpo against Croatia.
i
iThe Dutch boss will also likely give opportunities to Sven Botman, Tyrell
iMalacia and Marten De Roon - perhaps even from the first whistle.
i
iNetherlands possible XI: Bijlow; Dumfries, Van Dijk, Botman, Malacia; De
iRoon, De Jong; Bergwijn, Koopmeiners, Simons; Weghorst
i
iPosition Players Goalkeepers: Bijlow, Flekken, Noppert Defenders: Ake, Blind,
iBotman, Dumfries, Geertruida, Malacia, Timber, Van Dijk Midfielders: De Jong,
iDe Roon, Koopmeiners, Lang, Reijnders, Veerman, Wieffer, Wijnaldum Forwards:
iBergwijn, Gakpo, Malen, Simons, Weghorst
i
iRoberto Mancini could also make some changes to his side, as Mateo Retegui
imay be rewarded for his recent showings with a start ahead of Ciro Immobile.
i
iThe Italy boss will also likely revert to a 4-3-3 set-up with Wilfried Gnonto
iand Giacomo Raspadori joining the attack.
i
iThe changes could be limited, with Marco Verratti and Lorenzo Pellegrini
ikeeping their places in the middle, while Davide Frattesi's knee problem will
ilikely rule him out of contention.
i
iAlessandro Bastoni is also expected to be ruled out with a knock, as Matteo
iDarmian and Federico Dimarco are likely to start at the back.
i
iItaly possible XI: Donnarumma; Darmian, Toloi, Acerbi, Dimarco; Barella,
iVerratti, Pellegrini; Zaniolo, Retegui, Raspadori
i
iPosition Players Goalkeepers: Donnarumma, Meret, Vicario Defenders: Acerbi,
