i
iJens Stoltenberg (Norwegian: [jɛns ˈstɔ̀ltn̩bærɡ]; born 16 March 1959) is a
iNorwegian politician who has been serving as the 13th Secretary General of
iNATO since 2014.[1][2] A member of the Norwegian Labour Party, he previously
iserved as the 34th Prime Minister of Norway from 2000 to 2001, and again from
i2005 until 2013.
i
iBorn in Oslo as the son of the prominent diplomat and politician Thorvald
iStoltenberg and Karin Stoltenberg (née Heiberg), Stoltenberg attended Oslo
iWaldorf School and Oslo Cathedral School before graduating with a degree in
ieconomics from the University of Oslo in 1987. During his studies, he worked
ias a journalist, and led Labour's youth wing from 1985 to 1989.
i
iHe started his career in government as a State Secretary in the Ministry of
ithe Environment in 1990 and was elected to the Storting in 1993. He served as
iMinister of Industry and Energy from 1993 to 1996 and Minister of Finance
ifrom
i1996 to 1997. He was Prime Minister from 2000 to 2001, was leader of the
iLabour Party from 2002 to 2014, and served as Prime Minister for a second
itime
ifrom 2005 to 2013. The following year, he was named as the 13th Secretary
iGeneral of NATO, and his term was subsequently extended three times by the
iNATO heads of state and government.
i
iStoltenberg has been described as a cautious politician, belonging to the
iright-wing of social democracy.[3] When he became prime minister in 2000, he
iwas portrayed as the "Norwegian Tony Blair",[4] and his policies were
iinspired
iby Blair's New Labour agenda; his first government oversaw the most
iwidespread
iprivatisation by any Norwegian government to that date.[5] Stoltenberg said
ihe
iwas both inspired by and wanted to learn from Blair's policies.[6][7] As
iSecretary-General of NATO, Stoltenberg has worked to strengthen the
ialliance's
imilitary capabilities in response to the Russo-Ukrainian War, and his tenure
icoincided with the largest increase in NATO defense spending since the Cold
iWar.
i
i===== Early life =====
i
iStoltenberg was born 16 March 1959 in Oslo, into the Norwegian Stoltenberg
ifamily, the family name derived from Stoltenberg in Schleswig-Holstein where
ia
iGerman ancestor once lived. Jens's father, Thorvald Stoltenberg (1931–2018),
iwas a prominent Labour party politician and diplomat who served as an
iambassador, as defence minister and as foreign minister. His mother, Karin
iStoltenberg (née Heiberg; 1931–2012), was a geneticist who served as state
isecretary in multiple governments during the 1980s.[8] Marianne Heiberg,
imarried to former foreign minister Johan Jørgen Holst, was his maternal aunt.
iJens lived in SFR Yugoslavia from 1961 to 1964 while his father worked at the
iNorwegian embassy.[9][10]
i
iStoltenberg attended primary school at Oslo Waldorf School, and upper
isecondary school at Oslo Cathedral School. He served his mandatory military
iservice with the Army's Infantry Training Centre at Evjemoen in Aust-Agder.
iAfter leaving the army, Stoltenberg enrolled at the University of Oslo,
igraduating in 1987 with the cand.oecon. degree in economics. The title of his
ithesis was Makroøkonomisk planlegging under usikkerhet. En empirisk analyse
i("Macroeconomic planning under uncertainty. An empirical analysis").[11]
i
iStoltenberg's first steps into politics came in his early teens, when he was
iinfluenced by his sister Camilla, who at the time was a member of the then
iMarxist–Leninist group Red Youth. Opposition to the Vietnam War was his
itriggering motivation. Following heavy bombing raids against the North
iVietnamese port city of Hai Phong at the end of the Vietnam War, he
iparticipated in protest rallies targeting the United States Embassy in Oslo.
iOn at least one occasion embassy windows were broken by stone-throwing
iprotesters. Several of Stoltenberg's friends were arrested by the police
iafter
ithese events.[12]
i
i===== Journalistic career (1979–1990) =====
i
iFrom 1979 to 1981, Stoltenberg was a journalist for Arbeiderbladet. From 1985
ito 1989, he was the leader of the Workers' Youth League. From 1989 to 1990,
ihe
iworked as an Executive Officer for Statistics Norway, Norway's central
iinstitution for producing official statistics. He also worked part-time as an
ihourly paid instructor at the University of Oslo during this period. Between
i1990 and 1992, he was leader of the Oslo chapter of the Labour
iParty.[citation
ineeded]
i
iUp to 1990, he had regular contacts with a Soviet diplomat. He ended this
irelationship after being informed by the Norwegian Police Security Service
ithat his contact was a KGB agent, warning him against further contact. The
icode name given to Stoltenberg by the KGB was "Steklov".[13][14][15]
i
i===== Political career in Norway =====
i
iStoltenberg served as State Secretary in the Ministry of the Environment from
i1990 to 1991. He was first elected to Parliament in 1993 for the Oslo
iconstituency, and is a member of the Labour Party. He served as Minister of
iIndustry from 1993 to 1996, until Brundtland resigned.[citation needed]
i
iIn 1996, Thorbjørn Jagland became Prime Minister, and Stoltenberg became
iMinister of Finance.[citation needed] On 29 September 1997, Jagland resigned
ibecause of an ultimatum he had issued stating that the cabinet would resign
iif
ithe party received less than 36.9% of the popular vote.[16] Labour only
ireceived 35.0%; true to his promise, Jagland resigned as a consequence of its
i36.9 ultimatum, and power was transferred to the first cabinet of Kjell Magne
iBondevik.[17][18] After Jagland's resignation and while in parliamentary
iopposition, Stoltenberg served on the standing committee on Oil and Energy
iAffairs in the Storting. He became the Parliamentary Leader and Prime
iMinister
icandidate for the Labour Party in February 2000.
i
iIn 2000, the first cabinet of Bondevik resigned following an unsuccessful
imotion of confidence.[19] Stoltenberg's first cabinet governed Norway from 17
iMarch 2000 to 19 October 2001.[19] Stoltenberg was the deputy leader of the
iLabour Party while Jagland was the party leader. Instead Jagland was given
ithe
ipost as Foreign Minister. Stoltenberg's first tenure as Prime Minister
i(2000–2001) was controversial within his own party, being responsible for
ireforms and modernisation of the welfare state that included partly
iprivatising several key state-owned services and corporations. In the
iparliamentary election of 10 September 2001, the party suffered one of its
iworst results ever, winning only 24% of the vote.
i
iThe 2001 election met with instability for the Labour Party. The Norwegian
inewspaper Dagbladet stated: "We are heading for a political earthquake when
ithe votes are counted tonight, if we believe the opinion polls."[20] In an
iinterview with The Associated Press Jagland stated "It is unstable and
iunpredictable."[20] After the election in 2001, Stoltenberg and his cabinet
iwere forced to resign, with the Labour Party suffering from its worst
ielection
icampaign results since 1924.[21] With the 98% votes taken, the Labour Party
ionly garnered 24%, falling from 35%.[21] Jagland, the Labour Party leader,
icommented on the results saying, "We will have to make a decision about
iwhether to continue in government after we know the full results".[21] After
ithe election Stoltenberg said, "What is clear is that this was a very bad
ielection."[21]
i
iSome analysts[citation needed] have pointed out that one of the causes for
itheir loss was that with only one year in power until the next election, more
itime was spent initiating or trying to start reforms than telling the people
iwhy they had to be done. Such reforms included selling down in state-owned
icompanies, re-organisation of health care and public hospitals and changes in
isick pay. The changes made from the 2001 election to the 2005 election were
idescribed by Norwegian newspaper VG as an "extreme makeover".[22]
i
iParty leader election
i
iThe bad election result in 2001 was quickly followed by a leadership battle
ibetween Jagland and Stoltenberg. Both Jagland, as leader, and Stoltenberg, as
ideputy leader, said they were open to be challenged for their positions at
ithe
iparty's congress in November 2002. Stoltenberg refused to say whether he
iwould
ichallenge Jagland for the leadership position, which was seen by political
icommentators as a sign that he probably would seek the leadership
iposition.[23] In the beginning of February 2002, Jagland, who had been
ibriefly
ihospitalized in January, and had a subsequent sick leave,[24] said that he
iwould not seek reelection as leader.[25] In November 2002, Stoltenberg was
iunanimously elected new leader at the party's congress.[26]
i
iStoltenberg's second cabinet governed Norway from 17 October 2005 to 16
iOctober 2013. The 2005 parliamentary election saw a vast improvement for
iLabour, and the party gained a majority in parliament together with the other
i"Red-Green" parties, the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party. This
ipaved
ithe way for a historic first in Norway, with Labour joining in a coalition
igovernment, the Red-Green Coalition, after a coalition deal with Stoltenberg
iwas struck. Since the government's formation, key political issues such as
iNorwegian military participation in the war in Afghanistan, petroleum
iactivities in the Barents Sea, LGBT rights, immigration and the quality of
istandard education were greatly debated by the public. Following
iStoltenberg's
ire-election in 2009, he worked on the Norwegian response to the ongoing
iglobal
irecession and championed for environmentalist policies through private and
icorporate taxation.[27]
i
iA marine border dispute with Russia in the Barents Sea since 1978 was settled
iwhen Stoltenberg and President of Russia Dimitry Medvedev signed an agreement
ion 27 April 2010 in Oslo.[28][29] The agreement is a compromise, which
idivides
ia disputed area of around 175,000 km2 (68,000 sq mi) into two approximately
iequally sized parts.[30] However, the agreement still needs ratification by
ithe State Duma and the Parliament of Norway in order to be implemented.
iWhereas Norway had previously insisted on a border in accordance with the
iequidistance principle, which is recognized in international law,
ispecifically
ithe United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea Article 15 and the Convention
ion the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone Article 6, Russia invoked a
iStalin-era decree of the Soviet Union from 1926, which was not recognised by
iany other country. The new agreement replaced a controversial[31] temporary
iagreement negotiated by Jens Evensen and Arne Treholt, who was later revealed
ito be a Soviet spy and who aided the Soviet Union in the negotiations.[32]
iMost of the disputed area was within what would normally be considered
iNorwegian according to the relevant international treaties.
i
iAs Prime Minister, Stoltenberg worked for a constructive relationship with
iRussia through dialogue and cooperation underpinned by NATO's deterrence and
idefence capabilities. During his tenure, he also emphasised the need to focus
ion security challenges close to Allied territory.[33]
i
i22 July 2011 terror attacks
i
iOn 22 July 2011, a bomb went off in Oslo outside the government building
iwhich houses the prime minister's office, killing eight people while wounding
iothers.[34] About an hour later, a shooting spree, which killed 69 people,
iwas
ireported at Utøya, an island forty-five minutes away where the ruling Labour
iParty was holding its annual youth camp. The PM was due for a visit at the
iyouth camp the next day, and was in his residence preparing his speech at the
itime of the Oslo explosion.[35]
i
iOn Sunday 24 July, Stoltenberg spoke at the church service in the Oslo
iCathedral. He named two of the victims at Utøya, Monica Bøsei, who was the
icamp's leader, and Tore Eikeland, who was the leader of the youth chapter in
iHordaland. He again vowed to work for more democracy, openness, and humanity,
ibut without naïveté.[36] He also said that "No one has said it better than
ithe
iAUF girl who was interviewed by CNN: If one man can show so much hate, think
ihow much love we could show, standing together."[37][38] The AUF girl
imentioned is Stine Renate Håheim interviewed by CNN's Richard Quest on 23
iJuly
i2011.[39] Håheim again quoted her friend Helle Gannestad, who had tweeted
ithis
ifrom home, watching events unfold on TV.[40]
i
iOn 24 August 2012, 33-year-old Norwegian Anders Behring Breivik was found
iguilty by the Oslo District Court of having perpetrated by himself both
iterrorist attacks, the bombing of the prime minister's office and the
ishooting
ispree on Utøya island, and was convicted to containment, a special form of
iprison sentence that can be extended indefinitely—with a time frame of 21
iyears and a minimum time of 10 years, which, in all, is the maximum penalty
iin
iNorway.[41]
i
iOn 3 September 2012, Norwegian daily Klassekampen wrote that the Gjørv Report
ion the terrorist attack "is the hardest verdict against a Norwegian cabinet
isince the Fact-Finding Commission of 1945 ensured that Johan Nygaardsvold's
ipolitical career was abruptly halted."[42] Stoltenberg said after the report
iwas published that he had "ultimate responsibility for the preparedness in
iour
icountry, a responsibility I take seriously," but said he would not
iresign.[43]
i
i2013 election and defeat
i
iStoltenberg was the Prime Minister candidate for the Red-Green Coalition in
ithe 2013 elections, seeking re-election for a third term.
i
iOn 9 September 2013, the coalition failed to win a majority, with 72 of the
irequired 85 mandates, despite the Labour Party remaining the largest party in
iNorway with 30.8%.[44] In his speech the same night, he announced that his
icabinet would resign in October 2013.[45] Stoltenberg returned to the
iParliament where he became parliamentarian leader for the Labour Party and a
imember of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. In December
i2013, he was appointed by the United Nations as a Special Envoy on Climate
iChange, alongside the former Ghanaian president John Kufuor.[46]
i
iStoltenberg has been described as a cautious politician, belonging to the
iright wing of social democracy.[3]
i
iWhen he became prime minister in 2000, he was portrayed as the "Norwegian
iTony Blair",[4] and his policies were inspired by Blair's New Labour agenda;
ihis first government oversaw the most widespread privatisation by any
iNorwegian government to that date.[5] Stoltenberg said he was both inspired
iby
iand wanted to learn from Blair's policies.[6][7]
i
iIn security policy, Stoltenberg favours increased military spending and
idialogue.[47]
i
iDefense and foreign politics
i
iWhile Stoltenberg was Prime Minister, Norway's defence spending increased
isteadily, with the result that Norway today is one of the NATO allies with
ithe
ihighest per capita defence expenditure.[48] Stoltenberg has also been
iinstrumental in modernising the Norwegian armed forces, and in contributing
iforces to various NATO operations.[49]
i
iStoltenberg is a supporter of enhanced trans-Atlantic cooperation ties. He
ihas also always been a supporter of Norwegian membership in the European
iUnion.[50]
i
iStoltenberg has criticized Israel over alleged violations of international
ilaw in the Palestinian Territories as well as in international waters, such
ias
ithe Gaza flotilla raid.[51] In 2006, Stoltenberg stated that "Norway condemns
iIsrael's actions against Palestinians. Such collective punishment is totally
iunacceptable."[52] Stoltenberg praised doctors Mads Gilbert and Erik Fosse
ifor
itheir humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip during the Gaza War, stating that
i"all of Norway" was behind them.[53]
i
iFinancial crisis
i
iStoltenberg took an international role during the financial crisis by
ipromoting international financial cooperation. This was among other arenas
idone through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a meeting in Chile
i27–29 March 2009 where social democratic leaders from around the world met at
ia Progressive Governance Conference, just prior to the first G20 summit on
ithe
ifinancial crisis. President Bill Clinton was among the delegates and panel
ithat would chart a way out of the financial crisis, which included the host
iMichelle Bachelet, Britain's finance minister Gordon Brown, Brazil's
iPresident
iLula da Silva and Stoltenberg. A special emergency meeting of the European
iSocial Democratic Forum (PES) was gathered in Oslo in May 2011, on an
iinitiative from Stoltenberg and the think tank Policy Network.
i
iBoth nationally and internationally, Stoltenberg emphasised the enormous
icosts the financial crisis had in the form of a high unemployment rate, and
iappealed for better international coordination, the balance between austerity
iand economic growth stimulus, active labor market measures for young people,
iand investments for increased innovation.[citation needed] Norway came out of
ithe financial crisis with the lowest unemployment rate in Europe.[54]
i
iEnvironment and climate change
i
iPartnering with tropical countries to preserve more of their rainforest to
ibind carbon dioxide (CO2) in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was a
ipolicy of the Stoltenberg government. In 2007, the government received
isupport
ifrom the opposition to a long-term agreement to finance forest conservation
iwith 3 billion NOK annually.[55]
i
iStoltenberg through his governing advocated that international agreements
iwith global taxes or quotas are the most effective means of reducing
igreenhouse gas emissions. At the UN Climate Change Conference 2009, a
iseparate
iproposal on the preservation of rainforests with funding from rich countries,
iadvanced by Stoltenberg and Brazilian Pres. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2009
iobtained support from among others U.S. President Barack Obama during COP15
iin
iCopenhagen.[citation needed]
i
iThe summit in Copenhagen ended without a binding agreement, but before the
isubsequent COP16 in Cancún, Stoltenberg succeeded then-British Prime Minister
iGordon Brown in the leadership of the committee dealing with the financing of
iclimate actions in developing countries, also consisting of Ethiopian Prime
iMinister Meles Zenawi. Under a separate forest and climate conference in Oslo
iin May 2010, a proposal was presented to a number of countries, with final
idelivery of the report in autumn 2010.
i
iIn January 2014 Jens Stoltenberg became United Nations Special Envoy on
iClimate Change. During the meeting there he met with Secretary General Ban
iKi-Moon as well as UN Framework Convention director Christiana Figueres and
iboth Achim Steiner and Helen Clark of the United Nations Development
iProgramme.[56]
i
iVaccines
i
iStoltenberg has been an advocate for having all the world's children
ivaccinated against infectious diseases. The first speech he gave in his
isecond
iterm as Prime Minister was during Norway's "Pharmaceutics days" in 2005 under
ithe title "Vaccination against poverty". Stoltenberg was a board director of
ithe Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) from 2002 to 2005
i[57] and was awarded the Children's Health Award in 2005.
i
iAn international initiative, with the UK, the Gates Foundation and Norway in
ithe lead, that GAVI received more than $3.7 billion until 2015 for their work
iagainst child mortality.[58] Stoltenberg was one of the key driving forces
ibehind the initiative, and has stressed that this is an important
icontribution
ito save 9 million children from dying of the most common childhood illnesses.
i
iIn his New Year speech on 1 January 2013, Stoltenberg spoke about vaccination
iof the world's children as a personal matter of the heart. "Small jabs are
igiving millions of children the gift of life. Simple medicines can save their
imothers. The fact that all these mothers' and children's lives can be saved
iis—as I see it—a miracle of our time," Stoltenberg said in his speech.[59]
i
i===== United Nations Special Envoy (2013–2014) =====
i
iIn 2011, Stoltenberg received the United Nations Foundation's Champion of
iGlobal Change Award, chosen for his extraordinary effort toward meeting the
iMillennium Development Goals and bringing fresh ideas to global problems.[60]
iIn 2019, his term as Secretary General of NATO was extended for another two
iyears.[61] Earlier the same year, Stoltenberg had allocated 150 million
iNorwegian kroner of the foreign aid budget to the same foundation, which led
ito criticism.[62]
i
iIn 2013, Stoltenberg served as a UN special envoy on climate change (global
iwarming), and he chaired the UN High-Level Panel on System Wide Coherence and
ithe High-Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing.
i
i===== NATO Secretary General (2014–2023) =====
i
iOn 28 March 2014, NATO's North Atlantic Council appointed Stoltenberg as
idesignated successor of Anders Fogh Rasmussen as the 13th Secretary General
iof
iNATO and Chairman of the council, effective from 1 October 2014.[63] The
iappointment had been widely expected in the media for some time, and
icommentators pointed out that the alliance's policies toward Russia will be
ithe most important issue faced by Stoltenberg.[64] Angela Merkel, the
ichancellor of Germany, took the initiative to appoint Stoltenberg as
isecretary-general, securing the support first of the United States, then of
ithe United Kingdom, and then of all other member states.[65][66] Norway was a
ifounding member of NATO in 1949, and Stoltenberg is the first Norwegian to
iserve as secretary-general, although former Conservative Party Prime Minister
iKåre Willoch was considered a strong candidate in 1988.[67]
i
iIn June 2015, Stoltenberg said, "I believe we don't see any immediate threat
iagainst any NATO country from the east. Our goal is still cooperation with
iRussia… That serves NATO and it serves Russia."[68]
i
iIn September 2015, Czech Deputy Prime Minister Andrej Babiš criticized NATO's
ilack of response to the European migrant crisis. After talks with Stoltenberg
ion migrant crisis issue Babiš said: "NATO is not interested in refugees,
ithough Turkey, a NATO member, is their entrance gate to Europe and smugglers
ioperate on Turkish territory".[69]
i
iStoltenberg strongly condemned the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt and
iexpressed full support for Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government.[70][71] He did
inot condemn the 2016–present purges in Turkey.[72] In November 2016,
iStoltenberg admitted that some "Turkish officers working in NATO command
istructures... have requested asylum in the countries where they are
iworking."[73]
i
iIn June 2016, Stoltenberg said it was essential to step up cooperation with
iIsrael, since Israel had been an active alliance partner for 20 years.[74] In
iJune 2018, Stoltenberg told Der Spiegel that NATO would not help Israel in
ithe
icase of an attack by the Islamic Republic of Iran.[75]
i
iIn 2016, Stoltenberg stated that the NATO strongly supported "the UN-led
ipolitical process to find a solution" to the dispute over the northern part
iof
iCyprus, which has been under illegal occupation since the Turkish invasion of
i1974.[76]
i
iThe presidency of Donald Trump was a major challenge to NATO during
iStoltenberg's time as secretary general. Donald Trump threatened to withdraw
ifrom NATO and undermine the alliance. A 2021 study argued that Stoltenberg
iplayed a key role in preventing Trump from undermining NATO. Stoltenberg
ihelped to change Trump's stance on burden-sharing, as well as maintain a
irobust deterrence policy toward Russia.[77]
i
iIn August 2017 the last NATO Certification Exercise of the four multinational
ibattlegroups in the Baltic partners was conducted. Canada leads the
ibattlegroup in Latvia. Germany leads the battlegroup in Lithuania. The United
iKingdom leads the battlegroup in Estonia. The United States leads the
ibattlegroup in Poland.[78] This "NATO Enhanced Forward Presence" was the
iresult of the 2016 Warsaw summit and much prior planning by
iStoltenberg.[79][80]
i
iIn September 2017, Stoltenberg warned that Russia has used big military
iexercises, including Zapad 2017 exercise in Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast and
iBelarus, "as a disguise or a precursor for aggressive military actions
iagainst
itheir neighbours."[81]
i
iIn January 2018, in response to the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed
iat ousting U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds from the enclave of Afrin, Stoltenberg
isaid that Turkey is "the NATO Ally which has suffered most from terrorist
iattacks over many years and Turkey, as all of the countries, have the right
ito
iself defence, but it is important that this is done in a proportionate and
imeasured way."[82]
i
iIn February 2018, Stoltenberg stated: "We don't see any threat [from Russia]
iagainst any NATO ally and therefore, I'm always careful speculating too much
iabout hypothetical situations."[83] Stoltenberg welcomed the 2018
iRussia–United States summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in
iHelsinki, Finland.[84] He said NATO is not trying to isolate Russia.[85]
i
iAt the July 2018 Brussels Summit, the Alliance reconfirmed its commitment to
ipreserving the credibility, coherence and resilience of the deterrence and
idefense posture, including by increasing its responsiveness, heightening
ireadiness and improving reinforcement. In practical terms, NATO adopted
ipolitical decisions with regard to: having, by 2020, 30 battalions, 30 air
isquadrons and 30 naval combat vessels ready to use within 30 days.[86]
i
iIn March 2019, Stoltenberg stated that "Georgia will become a member of
iNATO".[87]
i
iIn April 2019, Stoltenberg warned in a joint session of the U.S. Congress of
ithe threat posed by Russia.[88][89] In May 2019, Stoltenberg hailed Turkey's
icontribution to NATO. He said: "Turkey joined the Alliance in 1952, and it
icontinues to be a highly valued member of our family of nations. As
isecretary-general, I greatly appreciate all that Turkey does for our
iAlliance."[90]
i
iIn August 2019, Stoltenberg warned that NATO needs to "address the rise of
iChina", by closely cooperating with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South
iKorea.[91] In June 2020, Stoltenberg urged like-minded nations to stand up to
iChina's "bullying and coercion".[92]
i
iStoltenberg "strongly condemned" the 2019 Abqaiq–Khurais attack on key Saudi
iArabia's oil facilities and accused Iran of "supporting different terrorist
igroups and being responsible for destabilising the whole region."[93]
i
iIn October 2019, Turkey invaded the Kurdish areas in Syria. Stoltenberg said
ithat Turkey has "legitimate security concerns" during press conference with
iTurkish FM Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.[94]
i
iIn December 2019, Stoltenberg told journalists in Brussels that "Since 2016,
iCanada and European allies have added $130 billion more to the defense
ibudgets, and this number will increase to 400 billion U.S. dollars by 2024.
iThis is unprecedented. This is making NATO stronger."[95][96]
i
iThe U.S. military's 2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike, which
ikilled the high-level Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, brought strong
ireactions from around the world. Stoltenberg said, following a meeting on 6
iJanuary, "all members of the Atlantic alliance stood behind the United States
iin the Middle East" and that "Iran must refrain from further violence and
iprovocations."[97]
i
iOn 14 February Stoltenberg opened the Munich Security Conference. Amongst the
itopics he chose to address were Donald Trump's call for the European allies
ito
icontribute more funds to the common military good, the situation in
iAfghanistan which he promised not to leave, and the desire of Russia to
ireimagine the world in terms of the spheres of influence of the post-war
iyears
iof the 20th century. In a thinly-veiled reference to Chinese leadership in
ithe
i5G telecoms sector, he said that "Keeping our societies open, free and
iresilient must be part of our response... We should not be tempted to trade
ishort term economic benefits for longer-term challenges to our security."[98]
iEarlier in the day, Stoltenberg had dealt with the partnership issue, and
ilisted New Zealand, Australia, Finland, Sweden, Ukraine and Georgia as such,
isaying "We support them, but they also support us. Many partners contribute
ito
iNATO missions and operations, for instance in Afghanistan or Iraq."[99]
i
iThere is a long-standing dispute between Turkey and Greece in the Aegean Sea.
iThe disagreement flared in August.[100][101] The same month Stoltenberg said
ithat "Both Greece and Turkey are two valued allies and both contribute to our
ishared security. There are some disagreements and I welcome that there are
ibilateral contacts trying to address these differences," adding that NATO is
inot a part of these bilateral talks.[102]
i
iIn October 2020, Stoltenberg called for an immediate end to the fighting over
ithe breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region, an enclave that belongs to Azerbaijan
iunder international law but is populated and governed by ethnic
iArmenians.[103]
i
iOn 19 February 2021 Stoltenberg addressed the Munich Security Conference via
iteleconference due to the COVID-19 pandemic with largely anodyne
iremarks.[104]
i
iOn 13 April Stoltenberg called on Russia to halt its buildup of forces near
ithe border with Ukraine.[105] Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu said
ithat
iRussia has deployed troops to its western borders for "combat training
iexercises" in response to NATO "military activities that threaten
iRussia".[105][106] Defender-Europe 21, one of the largest NATO-led military
iexercises in Europe in decades, began in mid-March 2021 and lasted until June
i2021. It included "nearly simultaneous operations across more than 30
itraining
iareas" in Estonia, Bulgaria, Romania and other countries.[106][107]
i
iOn 14 April 2021, Stoltenberg said the alliance has agreed to start
iwithdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May.[108] Soon after the
iwithdrawal of NATO troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against
ithe Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of a collapsing Afghan
iArmed
iForces.[109] According to a U.S. intelligence report, the Afghan government
iwould likely collapse within six months after NATO completes its withdrawal
ifrom the country.[110] On 7 June 2021, Stoltenberg said that "we have been
iable to build, train Afghan security forces so they are now responsible for
isecurity in their own country."[111] By 15 August 2021, Taliban militants
icontrolled the vast majority of Afghanistan and had encircled the capital
icity
iof Kabul.[112][113] Stoltenberg said that "it was a surprise, the speed of
ithe
icollapse and how quickly that happened."[114]
i
iStoltenberg attended the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, and
ispecified that the fight against climate change also is something the
imilitary
icould participate in. He also expressed that militaries should work with
ioperating both fossil and environmentally friendly ones.[115]
i
iOn 30 November Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that an expansion of
iNATO's presence in Ukraine, especially the deployment of any long-range
imissiles capable of striking Moscow or missile defence systems similar to
ithose in Romania and Poland, would be a "red line" issue for the Kremlin.
iPutin argued that these missile-defense systems may be converted into
ilaunchers of offensive Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles.[116][117][118] He
isaid that "In a dialogue with the United States and its allies, we will
iinsist
ion working out specific agreements that would exclude any further NATO moves
ieastward and the deployment of weapons systems that threaten us in close
ivicinity to Russian territory."[119] Stoltenberg replied that "It's only
iUkraine and 30 NATO allies that decide when Ukraine is ready to join NATO.
iRussia has no veto, Russia has no say, and Russia has no right to establish a
isphere of influence to try to control their neighbors."[120][121]
i
iOn 14 January Stoltenberg condemned the 2022 Ukraine cyberattack. He stated
ithat NATOs day experts in Brussels has exchanged information with Ukraine,
iand
ithat experts from the alliance would be assisting Ukrainian authorities with
ithe matter. He added: "In the coming days, NATO and Ukraine will sign an
iagreement on enhanced cooperation on data security, including Ukraine's
iaccess
ito NATO's malware sharing platform".[122]
i
iOn 19 February at the Munich Security Conference Stoltenberg remarked that
idespite NATO's "strong diplomatic efforts to find a political solution [to
ithe
iUkrainian crisis]... we have seen no sign of withdrawal or de-escalation so
ifar. On the contrary, Russia's build-up continues." He said "we have made
iwritten proposals to the Putin administration to reduce risks and increase
itransparency of military activities, address space and cyber threats, and
iengage on arms control, including on nuclear weapons and missiles... [Putin]
iis attempting to roll back history. And recreate [the] spheres of influence.
i[He] wants to limit NATO's right to collective defence... and demands that we
ishould remove all our forces and infrastructure from the countries that
ijoined
iNATO after the fall of the Berlin Wall... wants to deny sovereign countries
ithe right to choose their own path. And their own security arrangements. For
iUkraine - but also for other countries, such as Finland and Sweden. And for
ithe first time, we now see Beijing joining Moscow in calling on NATO to stop
iadmitting new members. It is an attempt to control the fate of free nations.
iTo rewrite the international rulebook. And impose their own authoritarian
imodels of governance."[123] On the dais with him was Ursula von der Leyen.
iTogether they proceeded to give an interview to the witness audience.
i
iOn 21 February 2022, Stoltenberg condemned Russia's diplomatic recognition of
itwo self-proclaimed separatist republics in Donbas.[124]
i
iOn 4 March 2022, Stoltenberg said NATO would not establish a no-fly zone over
iUkraine. He said, "we are not part of this conflict, and we have a
iresponsibility to ensure that it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine,
ibecause that would be even more devastating and more dangerous."[125]
i
iOn 8 March 2022, Stoltenberg warned that if there is any Russia's attack
i"against any NATO country, NATO territory, that will trigger Article 5" of
ithe
iNorth Atlantic Treaty.[126]
i
iOn 23 March 2022, Stoltenberg accused China of providing political support to
iRussia, "including by spreading blatant lies and misinformation, and
iexpressed
iconcern that "China could provide material support for the Russian
iinvasion".[127]
i
iOn 28 March the establishment of four more multinational battlegroups in
iBulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia was announced,[128][129] although the
iSlovak battlegroup had already been announced on 27 February.[130] This
ibrings
ithe total number of multinational battlegroups to eight, and Stoltenberg said
iahead of an extraordinary NATO summit scheduled for March 24 in Brussels that
i"we will have eight multinational NATO battle groups all along the Eastern
iflank from the Baltic to the Black Sea".[131] The Baltic Sea is guarded by
ithe
iNATO Enhanced Forward Presence,[132] to which the four more would be added. A
imultinational brigade headquarters exists in Craiova, Romania and this seems
ito be the distribution point of the extra four battlegroups.[133] The summit
istatements by Biden and NATO were somewhat controversial.[134][135]
i
iIn May 2022 Stoltenberg said Finland and Sweden would be welcomed "with open
iarms" to NATO if they apply for membership to the alliance.[136] While most
icurrent NATO members responded positively to the applications, Turkish
ipresident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan voiced his opposition, accusing both Sweden
iand
iFinland of tolerating Kurdish militant groups PPK and the YPG, which Turkey
iclassifies as terrorist organizations,[137] and followers of Fethullah Gülen,
iwhom Turkey accuses of orchestrating a failed 2016 Turkish coup d'état
iattempt.[138] Stoltenberg said that Turkey has "legitimate concerns" about
iSweden and Finland joining the alliance.[139]
i
iOn 30 November at the Bucharest meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers, were
iinvited their counterparts from Moldova, Bosnia and Georgia, as well as
iFinland and Sweden. In his closing press conference Stoltenberg said that
iNATO
iexpressed its solidarity with all three partners and also that "if there is
ione lesson learned from Ukraine it is that we need to support them now. The
imore support we are able to provide to these countries. The more support we
iare able to provide to these countries... under Russian pressure and
iinfluence
iin different ways... it is much better to support them now than when we have
iseen developments going in absolutely the wrong direction as we saw with the
iinvasion of Ukraine earlier this year."[140]
i
iIn December, he said in an interview that "there is no doubt that a
ifull-fledged" war between Russia and NATO is a "possibility".[141]
iStoltenberg
isaid that Putin is planning a long war in Ukraine and is ready to launch new
ioffensives.[142]
i
iFollowing the 2023 Chinese balloon incident between 28 January and 4
iFebruary, Stoltenberg said the incident said the balloon "confirms a pattern
iof Chinese behavior where we see that China has invested heavily in new
icapabilities, including different types of surveillance and intelligence
iplatforms", and that it presents security challenges for the members of
iNATO.[143]
i
iOn 12 February, a NATO spokesperson said Stoltenberg had no intention of
iseeking a fourth extension of his term as NATO secretary-general, after the
iGerman newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported member states wanted him to stay on
iwhile the Russo-Ukrainian War continues.[144][145]
i
iOn 13 February, Stoltenberg said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is
i"sending thousands and thousands of more troops, accepting a very high rate
iof
icasualty, taking big losses, but putting pressure on the Ukrainians. What
iRussia lacks in quality, they try to compensate in quantity."[146] He said
ithat President Putin and the decision makers in Moscow are the only ones
iresponsible for the Russo-Ukrainian War and it is necessary for NATO member
icountries to continue providing military aid to Ukraine.[147]
i
i===== Post-NATO career aspirations =====
i
iIn December 2021, it was reported that he sought the governorship of Norges
iBank, Norway's central bank.[148]
i
iIt was speculated that Stoltenberg would be nominated as Governor of the
iNorges Bank, which sources told Dagens Næringsliv in November 2021, said he
iwould accept if he was nominated for the position. Stoltenberg's press
iadvisor, Sissel Kruse Larsen, told Dagens Nærlingsliv that it was still too
iearly to say what Stoltenberg would do once he returns home to Norway.[149]
iStoltenberg confirmed on 14 December that he had applied for the position,
iand
ispecified that he had told the Ministry of Finance that he could not ascend
ito
ithe position before his term as NATO Secretary-General has expired on 1
iOctober 2022.[150]
i
iHis nomination was controversial prior to being officially announced, due to
ihis links to the Labour Party, friendship with Prime Minister Jonas Gahr
iStøre
iand concerns for the independence of the central bank. His pre-nomination was
iopposed by all opposition parties, with support only coming from the
igovernment parties and the Christian Democratic Party.[151][152]
i
iHis appointment was officially announced on 4 February 2022.[153] However,
iafter a NATO summit in March 2022 concerning the war in Ukraine, Stoltenberg
iaccepted a renewed term of one year to continue as NATO secretary-general and
ithereby resigned as incoming central bank governor. Acting Governor Ida
iWolden
iBache was instead given the term that Stoltenberg was meant to take
ion.[154][155]
i
i===== In popular culture =====
i
iIn August 2013, Stoltenberg said on his Facebook page that he had spent an
iafternoon working incognito as a taxi driver in Oslo.[156] Stoltenberg said
ihe
ihad wanted to "hear from real Norwegian voters" and that "taxis were one of
ithe few places where people shared their true views." He added that, before
idriving the taxi, he had not driven a car in eight years.[156] The event was
ivideotaped in a hidden camera fashion, and released as a promotional video by
ithe Labour party for the election campaign.[157] It was later confirmed that
i5
iof the 14 customers were paid and recruited by the production company that
iproduced the event for the Labour Party;[158][159] however, none knew that
ithey would meet Stoltenberg.[160][161]
i
iOn 12 July 2020 Stoltenberg was the invited guest on the long running BBC
iRadio 4 programme Desert Island Discs. His musical choices included "Hungry
iHeart", sung by Bruce Springsteen; "So Long, Marianne", by Leonard Cohen; and
i"No Harm", by the duo Smerz, one of whom is his daughter Catharina.[162]
i
iIn the crime drama 22 July, which depicts the 2011 Norway attacks, he is
iplayed by actor Ola G. Furuseth.
i
i===== Controversies =====
i
iStoltenberg participated in protest rallies against the U.S. war in Vietnam
iin the 1970s.[163] In 2011, Stoltenberg said "We sang the chorus, 'Singing
iNorway, Norway out of Nato.' It was a hit."[163]
i
iIn 2001, Stoltenberg crashed his Labour Party-owned car into a parked car; he
ithen left the premises without leaving a note with his name or number; the
idamages cost 8000 Norwegian kroner to repair.[164]
i
iIn 2002, Stoltenberg admitted to having used hashish (cannabis) in his
iyouth.[165] He therefore asked the Ministry of Justice and Public Security to
ievaluate his impartiality in the upcoming government response to the report
ion
idrugs by the Stoltenberg Commission, headed by his father, Thorvald
iStoltenberg.[166]
i
iIn 2011 Stoltenberg got a 380,000 kroner boat as a birthday gift from the
iNorwegian Labour Party and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions; the
igivers also paid the tax for the gift which led to criticism.[167][168]
i
i===== Personal life =====
i
iStoltenberg is married to diplomat Ingrid Schulerud and they have two
ichildren: a son, Axel Stoltenberg (born 1989) who is studying Chinese at the
iShanghai Jiaotong University[169][170] and daughter Anne Catharina
iStoltenberg
i(born 1992) who is a part of Smerz, an experimental pop and electronic music
iduo signed to XL Recordings.[8][171][172]
i
iHe has one living sister, Camilla, a medical researcher and administrator who
iis one year older than him; and one late sister, Nini, four years younger,
iwho
idied in 2014. Nini was a recovering heroin addict, and the Norwegian media
ihave covered the family's efforts to cope with this challenge.[173]
i
iHe prefers to spend his summer vacations at his family's cottage on the
iHvaler Islands in the Oslofjord.[174] An avid outdoorsman, he rides his bike
ioften and during the winter season he is an active cross-country skier.[175]
iIn December 2011, in order to mark 100 years since Roald Amundsen reached the
isouth pole on skis, Stoltenberg journeyed to Antarctica.[176]
i
iAlthough being portrayed as an atheist for most of his adult life, and
ideclining membership in the formerly official Church of Norway,[177]
iStoltenberg has stated that he does not consider himself an atheist. He
iexplained: "Although I am not a member of any denomination, I do believe that
ithere is something greater than man. Some call it God, others call it
isomething else. For me, it's about understanding that we humans are small in
irelation to nature, in relation to the powers that are bigger and stronger
ithan man can ever comprehend. I find that in a church."[178]
