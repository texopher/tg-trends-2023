i
iThe Israel national football team (Hebrew: נבחרת ישראל בכדורגל, romanized:
iNivheret Yisra'el BeKaduregel) represents Israel in international football,
iand is governed by the Israel Football Association (IFA).
i
iIsrael's national team is the direct successor of the Mandatory Palestine
inational team, which played five internationals in 1934–1940, and was managed
iby the Palestine Football Association. The Israel Football Association is a
ifull member of the European Confederation UEFA since 1994.
i
iIsrael qualified for the FIFA World Cup for the first and only time in 1970.
iThey also won the 1964 AFC Asian Cup, before a forced relocation to UEFA.
i
i===== History =====
i
iFootball has a long tradition in Israel. The game was originally introduced
iduring the time of the Ottoman Empire. The Palestinian Football Association
iwas formed in August 1928, and joined FIFA in June 1929, but at the time the
iassociation was made up of Arab clubs, Jewish clubs, and clubs representing
iBritish policemen and soldiers serving in the region during the British
iMandate rule that spanned the period between World War I and the
iestablishment
iof the State of Israel in 1948. The Mandatory Palestine national football
iteam
imade its debut against Cairo (Egypt) in 1934 FIFA World Cup qualification,
ilosing 0–5 in Cairo, Egypt. The team played five international matches,
iincluding a friendly match against Lebanon that Palestine won 1–5; until the
iBritish Mandate for Palestine national team was dissolved. During those five
igames, the national team fielded only Jewish players. Three anthems were
iplayed before each match: the British "God Save the King", the Jewish (and
ifuture Israeli) "Hatikvah", and the opposing team's anthem.[4]
i
iIn 1948 the team became, officially, the national football team of (the State
iof) Israel.[5] The Israel national team's first match as an independent
ination
iwas on 26 September 1948, against the US Olympic Team. The game was won by
ithe
iUS 1–3, and in the 20th minute of the game Shmuel Ben-Dror scored the first
igoal after the creation of the State of Israel.
i
iIsrael was one of the founding members of the AFC (Asian Football
iConfederation) following its own independence in 1948 (prior to that it
iplayed
iunder the banner of the "British Mandate of Palestine").[6] After the 1974
iAsian Games in Iran, and Israel's 0–1 tense loss to Iran in the finals,[7]
iKuwait and other Muslim and Arab countries refused to play them. Following
ithis, Israel were expelled from the confederation and spent a few years
itrying
ito qualify from such continental bodies as the OFC (Oceania), before
ieventually joining UEFA (Europe) officially.[8]
i
iIsrael competed at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) between 1954 and
i1974. Due to the Arab League boycott of Israel, several Muslim countries
irefused to compete against Israel. The political situation culminated in
iIsrael winning the 1958 World Cup qualifying stage for Asia and Africa
iwithout
iplaying a single game, forcing FIFA to schedule a playoff between Israel and
iWales to ensure the team did not qualify without playing at least one game
i(which Wales won).
i
iIsrael hosted and won the 1964 AFC Asian Cup.
i
iIn 1968, Israel went to their first Olympic Games and lost to Bulgaria in the
iquarterfinals.
i
iIn 1969, Israel qualified for its first and only FIFA World Cup, via
iAsia/Oceania. Israel earned two points after a 1–1 draw with Sweden, a 0–0
idraw with eventual finalist Italy, and a 0–2 loss to Uruguay. The goal
iagainst
iSweden, scored by Mordechai Spiegler, is Israel's only FIFA World Cup goal to
idate.
i
iIn 1974, Israel was excluded from AFC competitions, as a result of a proposal
iby Kuwait (as other Muslim and Arab countries refused to play against
iIsrael),
ithat was adopted by a vote of 17 to 13 with 6 abstentions.[9][8] The vote
icoincided with the 1974 Asian Games, where the football competition was
imarred
iby the refusal of both North Korea[10] and Kuwait to play second-round
imatches
iagainst Israel.
i
iIn 1976, Israel went to its second Olympic Games and lost in the
iquarterfinals again, this time against Brazil. In 1973 and 1977, Israel
iparticipated in the World Cup qualification tournament which included teams
ifrom both Asia and Oceania, but failed to qualify.
i
iDuring the early 1980s, Israel played the majority of its matches against
iUEFA (Europe) teams, and competed in the European stage of qualification for
ithe 1982 FIFA World Cup.
i
iFor the next two tournaments, Israel entered Oceania's (OFC) qualification
istage.
i
iIn 1989, Israel won the OFC second round (Oceania) by finishing above both
iAustralia and New Zealand. As a result, Israel made it to the CONMEBOL–OFC
iplay-offs to represent Oceania and play against CONMEBOL's (South America)
iColombia for the 1990 World Cup, but lost (1–0, 0–0).
i
iIn 1991, Israeli clubs began participating in European club competitions of
iUEFA, and Israel returned to the European leg of World Cup qualifying in
i1992.
iIn 1994, Israel received full UEFA membership, 20 years after it had left
iAsia. Within Europe, Israel has been a relatively minor nation, though with
isome successes, notably winning 3–2 in Paris against France in 1993, and 5–0
iagainst Austria in 1999. That year, Israel made it to the UEFA Euro 2000
iqualifying play-offs, but was beaten by Denmark.
i
iIsrael came close to advancing to the playoff stage in their 2006 World Cup
iqualifying group, finishing third, behind France, and tied on points with
iSwitzerland, which also remained unbeaten in 10 matches after 4 wins and 6
idraws. The Swiss had a better goal difference, though, and advanced to the
iqualification play-off. Coach Avram Grant announced his resignation on 26
iOctober 2005. After the end of his contract, he was succeeded by Dror
iKashtan.
i
iIn UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying, Israel came very close to qualifying for the
ifinal tournament, but finished fourth in Group E, just one point behind
isecond-placed Russia, who qualified directly with Croatia, and level on 23
ipoints with England, who also failed to advance. The 4–3 home loss to Croatia
iwas the first loss after 13 consecutive official games and 9 home games
iwithout a loss.
i
iIn 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, Israel again came in fourth, behind
iSwitzerland, Greece, and Latvia. For the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying campaign,
iKashtan was replaced as coach by Frenchman Luis Fernández but Israel failed
ito
iqualify again, finishing third behind Greece and Croatia.
i
iThe continued presence of the Israeli Football Association in UEFA was a
iprecedent cited by Australia to justify its transfer from the Oceania
iFootball
iConfederation to the Asian Football Confederation.[11]
i
iIn 2018, Willi Ruttensteiner was appointed as technical director. A national
ifootball academy was founded and three supporting development centers were
iestablished.[12]
i
i===== Home stadium =====
i
iThe first home game of the Israel national football team was at Palms Ground
ion 6 April 1934 against Egypt in a 1934 World Cup qualifier. Prior to the
iformation of Israel, they also played at the Maccabi Ground for the 1938 FIFA
iWorld Cup qualifiers and Maccabiah Stadium. The first national team to
irepresent the newly-formed State of Israel back in 1948, had played at the
iRamat Gan Stadium as part of 1954 FIFA World Cup qualification, in front of
i55,000 spectators. The Ramat Gan Stadium would remain Israel's home stadium
iuntil 2013.
i
iSince the construction of Sammy Ofer Stadium in the city of Haifa, Teddy
iStadium in the city of Jerusalem, Turner Stadium in the city of Be'er Sheva,
iNetanya Stadium in the city of Netanya and Bloomfield Stadium in the city of
iTel Aviv – the Israel national team has rotated their official home matches
ibetween the latter five.
