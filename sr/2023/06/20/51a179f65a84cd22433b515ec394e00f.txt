i
iNeymar no longer wants to leave Paris Saint-Germain this summer and is
iinstead looking forward to a reunion with ex-Barcelona manager Luis Enrique.
i
iThe Brazilian superstar, 31, was recently tipped to join Manchester United
iafter reportedly setting his sights on a move to Old Trafford. United boss
iErik ten Hag remains keen on bolstering his attack during the summer transfer
iwindow and PSG were said to be open to selling Neymar, having signed him from
iBarca in 2017 for a then-world-record fee.
i
iBut Enrique's imminent arrival in Paris is likely to halt any move away for
iNeymar, with his old manager advanced talks with the PSG hierarchy. It comes
iafter club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and sporting advisor Luis Campos
igreen-lit Enrique's appointment, despite current boss Christophe Galtier
istill
iofficially being in the hot seat.
i
iL'Equipe report that the turn of events has changed Neymar's mind on leaving
ithe French capital over the next few months and he's focussed on coming back
istronger with PSG. The 31-year-old suffered a season-ending injury in March,
iforcing him to miss vital games during the run-in.
i
iNeymar worked with Enrique to great success while they were together for
ithree seasons at Barcelona between 2014 and 2017. The Brazil international
iwon
ihis one and only Champions League crown during the former Spain boss'
itrophy-laden reign, as well as two lifting LaLiga titles.
i
iPSG signed Neymar in the hope that he'd drive them to their first ever
iChampions League, but a runners-up medal in 2020 is the best that he has to
ishow for his efforts. Perhaps Enrique can be the man to deliver what
iAl-Khelaifi and co have always craved, but the situation leaves United
ilooking
ielsewhere for new signings in the forward department.

ithe comments section.
i
iThat might turn out to be a good thing, though, at least according to ex-Red
iDevils assistant manager Rene Meulensteen. "It's probably rumours and
ispeculation, everybody keeps tight-lipped about it," the Dutch coach, who
imost
inotably worked directly under Sir Alex Ferguson, told talkSPORT. "I have my
ireservations about it because he's obviously a high-calibre player but he's
ialso a prima donna.
i
i"He's never played in the Premier League. Playing in Spain and France is
icompletely different. Also, his best position is playing on the left wing and
iyou're gonna go with [Marcus] Rashford."
i
iIn contrast, former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Petit reckons that Neymar
iwould "love" to play for the Gunners. "I think Neymar will suit any big
iclub,"
iPetit told Genting Casino. "If he comes to Arsenal, I would love it and I
ithink he will too. I think he will enjoy the technical football and the style
iof Arsenal. He would love to play with younger players as he is quite mature
ihimself.
i
i"He will also have revenge on his mind with everything that he has been going
ithrough at PSG, and the tears he shed at the World Cup. I think he will be
ihappy to move to Arsenal if that is the case. He can play on the left and the
iright, and because of his ankle injuries he can be a player in rotation."
