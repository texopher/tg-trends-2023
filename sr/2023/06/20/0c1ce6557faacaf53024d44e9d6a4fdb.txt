iPallacanestro Olimpia Milano, commonly known as Olimpia Milano or as EA7
iEmporio Armani Milan after its title sponsor,[2] is an LBA Italian
iprofessional basketball team, based in Milan, Italy. Its colors are white and
ired, and the team is sometimes referred as "Scarpette Rosse" (Little Red
iShoes) because team officials imported red Converse All-Star shoes for
iplayers
ifrom the United States. The tag line stuck, and the nickname is still used by
imany fans today.
i
iAs per custom in the Italian league, sponsorship has kept the team name
ichanging frequently. From 1930 until 1955, it was called Borletti Milano.
iFrom
i1956 to 1973, it was renamed Simmenthal. Other famous sponsorship names were
iBilly, Simac, Tracer, and Philips, in the 1980s. For past club sponsorship
inames, see the list below.
i
iOlimpia is the most successful basketball club in Italy and one of the most
isuccessful in Europe, having won 29 Italian League Championships, 8 Italian
iNational Cups, 4 Italian Super Cups, 3 EuroLeague, 1 FIBA Intercontinental
iCup, 3 FIBA Saporta Cups, 2 FIBA Korać Cups and many junior titles.
i
iIn 2016, the club was included in the Italian Basketball Hall of Fame.
i
i===== History =====
i
iThe birth of Pallacanestro Olimpia Milano is traditionally dated 1936, year
iof the first Italian League Championship title. Actually it was founded 6
iyears earlier (in 1930) as "Dopolavoro Borletti" by Fratelli Borletti
imanagers.[3] Borletti team won 4 consecutive Italian League Championships
ifrom
i1936 to 1939.
i
iIn 1947, Milan businessman Adolfo Bogoncelli merged Pallacanestro Como and
iBorletti to form a new society,[4] commonly known as "Borolimpia". "Borletti"
ibrand was the main sponsor of the team, becoming the first sponsor in the
ihistory of Italian sport.[5]
i
iIn 1955, after 9 Italian League Championships, Borletti brand leaves Olimpia
iMilano jersey.
i
iThe team regularly won the Italian League Championship in the 1950s and the
i1960s, with players including Gabriele Vianello, Sandro Riminucci, Gianfranco
iPieri, and Bill Bradley. In 1966, Olimpia won its first FIBA European
iChampions Cup.
i
iIn the 1970s, three teams were fighting across Europe for supremacy: Olimpia
iMilano, Ignis Varese, and Real Madrid. Pallacanestro Varese and Olimpia
iMilano
iwere arch-rivals, as the two cities are 25 miles (40 km) apart. While Milano
iwas a frequent Italian League champion, they were unable to win again the
iprestigious FIBA European Champions Cup. Late in the 1970s, the quality of
ithe
iclub declined, but Olimpia Milano still managed to win a FIBA Cup Winners'
iCup.
i
iIn 1973, Simmenthal brand leaves Olimpia jersey after 17 years and 10 Italian
iLeague Championships.
i
iIn the 1970s through the 1980s, the team acquired several notable players,
iincluding the Boselli twins (Franco and Dino), Mike Sylvester, Chas Menatti,
iDino Meneghin, Mike D'Antoni, John Gianelli, Roberto Premier. Bob McAdoo, Joe
iBarry Carroll, Russ Schoene, Antoine Carr, and Mike Brown. American head
icoach
iDan Peterson led the team back to prominence.
i
iIn the 1980s, the team was sold to the Gabetti family. After this, they
iqualified for nine Serie A championships finals, winning five, with the 1987
iteam winning the Serie A title, the 1986–87 FIBA European Champions Cup (won
ialso in 1988: both finals were won against Maccabi Tel Aviv), the Italian Cup
iand the 1987 FIBA Club World Cup. This gave the club the coveted "Triple
iCrown" and the even rarer "Quadruple Crown".
i
iLed by point guard Sasha Djordjević, the team won another FIBA Korać Cup in
i1993. Bepi Stefanel purchased the team franchise in 1994, and signed-up
inotable European players like Dejan Bodiroga, Gregor Fučka, Sandro De Pol,
iand
iNando Gentile. In 1996, the team won the Italian Cup and its 25th Italian
iNational Championship, celebrating the 60th anniversary of the club.
i
iTeam management was inconsistent, as ownership groups from 1998 to 2004.
iPlayers of the team included Warren Kidd, Hugo Sconochini, Claudio Coldebella
iand Petar Naumoski. In 2005, owner Corbelli, which bought the club in 2002,
ifrom Sergio Tacchini, was flanked by Adriano Galliani (managing director of
iItalian Football club A.C. Milan), Massimo Moratti (President of rival club
iInternazionale), NBA star Kobe Bryant, and stylist Giorgio Armani, as sponsor
iwith the Armani Jeans brand. After difficult years, led by coach Lino Lardo,
iOlimpia reached the national championship Finals, finally being beaten by
iClimamio Bologna.
i
iOn January 25, 2006, in the midst of a disappointing season in the EuroLeague
iand domestically, Djordjevic was named as the team's new coach. He left as
icoach after the 2006–07 season, but not before securing Olimpia a berth in
ithe
i2007–08 Euroleague.
i
iIn 2008, Giorgio Armani bought the team from Giorgio Corbelli, standing as
ithe only owner, entirely changing the management structure, naming Livio
iProli
ias president, and Lucio Zanca as general manager. Piero Bucchi was chosen to
icoach the new team, leading Olimpia twice to second place in LEGA Basket,
ibeing defeated by Montepaschi Siena in both cases.
i
iIn January 2011, after 23 years, coach Dan Peterson came back from retirement
ito replace Piero Bucchi as head coach. However, his stint at Olimpia Milano
ithis time was quite short: after failing to reach the championship Finals, on
iJune 9, Olimpia Milano announced Sergio Scariolo as new head coach for the
i2011–12 season. The first player signed for the 2011–12 season was Omar Cook,
ian American-born play maker, who had played the previous season with Power
iElectronics Valencia. Owing to the NBA lockout, Danilo Gallinari went back to
ihis alma mater, playing 15 games (8 in the Italian League, 7 in EuroLeague):
ihe left the team in December. Sergio Scariolo was replaced by Luca Banchi at
ithe beginning of the 2013–14 season, and the team brought from Montepaschi
iSiena: David Moss, Kristjan Kangur, and Daniel Hackett.
i
iThe team reached the quarterfinals of EuroLeague, 16 years after its last
iappearance, but the team lost against the eventual league champions, Maccabi
iTel Aviv. The team finished in the 1st position the LEGA Basket regular
iseason, and in the 7th game of the playoff's finals, Olimpia won its 26th
iItalian League championship title, its first after 18 years. Alessandro
iGentile, the captain of Olimpia, was named MVP of the finals.
i
iOn June 29, 2017, Simone Pianigiani was hired as the new head coach and on
iJune 15, 2018, Milano went to win his 28th title by beating Dolomiti Energia
iTrento in game 6 of the 2018 LBA Finals.[6]
i
iOn June 11, 2019, legend Ettore Messina signed a deal as the new head coach
iof the club and president of all basketball operations for the following
ithree
iseasons.[7]
i
iOn May 4, 2021, the club reached the Euroleague Final Four after 29 years
i(1992 Final Four).[8]

iOlimpia Milano used the OND Borletti outdoor court of Via Costanza for almost
i20 years. In the mid-1940s, they moved to the Palazzo dello Sport della
iFiera,
iwhich had a seating capacity of 18,000 people, and was then the largest
iindoor
isports arena in Europe, and second only to the Madison Square Garden in New
iYork City. In 1960, the Palazzo dello Sport della Fiera was abandoned, and
iOlimpia moved into the original structure of the PalaLido, which then had a
ismaller seating capacity of 3,500, but because of lack of security measures
iat
ithe time, often was filled with up to 10,000 people.
i
iAt the end of the 1970s, Olimpia moved into the newly built Palasport di San
iSiro, a multi-purpose facility built next to the Meazza Stadium, that was
iable
ito hold about 15,000 spectators. In 1985, the roof of the Palasport di San
iSiro collapsed and Olimpia returned to PalaLido for a season, waiting for the
iconstruction of a provisional arena. In 1986, they moved into the recently
ibuilt 10,045 seat PalaTrussardi, where they played through the early 1990s.
i
iThe club then moved into its current home arena, the Mediolanum Forum, which
ihas a seating capacity of 12,700.[9] The club has also played some home games
iat the 6,700 seat PalaDesio. Recently, the club considered moving back to the
inewly rebuilt and modernized PalaLido (named Allianz Cloud), after it was
iremodeled, and had its seating capacity expanded. However, the club
iultimately
idecided to continue using the Mediolanum Forum as its home arena, due to its
imuch larger seating capacity, as compared to the new Allianz Cloud. However,
ithe new arena is used when Mediolanum Forum is unavailable.
