iDanish rock and rollers VOLBEAT played their second concert with their new
itouring guitarist Flemming C. Lund (THE ARCANE ORDER) on Friday (June 16) at
ithe Ullevi stadium in Gothenburg, Sweden as the support act for METALLICA.
iFan-filmed video of the performance can be seen below.
i
iOn June 5, VOLBEAT announced that it had officially parted ways with
iguitarist Rob Caggiano. No reason was given for the split, but the remaining
ibandmembers said that they wished their "brother Rob all the best with
ieverything he does in the future." They went on to thank Rob "for ten amazing
iyears."
i
iA day later, Lund commented on his decision to accept the offer to play with
iVOLBEAT on the band's 2023 shows, saying in a statement: "The cat's out of
ithe
ibag! Sometimes unexpected things happen in life and this must be said to be
ione of them: I can now finally reveal that I will be playing stand-in in
iVOLBEAT for Rob Caggiano on lead guitar on VOLBEAT's upcoming summer tour.
iThis means I'm playing all upcoming European festival shows in Finland,
iNorway, Sweden (warming up for METALLICA),Switzerland, Germany and Austria as
iwell as the US/Canada tour in July and August.
i
i"When I was asked by Michael Poulsen not many weeks ago if I wanted to help
ithem, I was honestly at first very overwhelmed by the request and found it
ivery difficult to see myself in that role. But after a little time to think
iand talk with those closest to me, it dawned on me that it was something I
icould not possibly say no to.
i
i"So this summer takes a somewhat unexpected, but obviously insanely cool
iturn. I will try to enjoy every moment and just take in the many experiences
iand impressions that will surely be an experience of a lifetime.
i
i"A big thank you must go to my fantastic workplace MCB for the great
iflexibility so that it could be successful, and not least to my better half
iJulie who, as usual, supported and stood behind me!"
i
iTHE ARCANE ORDER is a Danish extreme metal quintet which released its fourth
ialbum, "Distortions From Cosmogony", on June 9 via Black Lion Records.
i
iOn June 12, Rob — who played on VOLBEAT's last four studio albums: 2013's
i"Outlaw Gentlemen & Shady Ladies", 2016's "Seal the Deal & Let's Boogie",
i2019's "Rewind, Replay, Rebound" and 2021's "Servant Of The Mind" — issued a
istatement in which he said he was "extremely proud of everything" he and how
inow-former bandmates "accomplished together over the last 10 years."
i
iAs for why his time with VOLBEAT had come to an end, Rob said: "Sometimes
irelationships simply run their course. Sometimes certain obstacles, people or
icircumstances get in the way of the greater good. Sometimes people change and
ipriorities shift. Sometimes it's unavoidable. We had a very special
iundeniable
imagic together as a band. It's not something that comes around too often in
ithis life and it's not something to be taken lightly. I certainly do not.
iHowever, while this is really a very emotional time for me I'm also extremely
iexcited about what lies ahead in the future. Lots of exciting things
ihappening
iright now. I really couldn't be more fired up!!"

iAn acclaimed musician, songwriter and producer, Caggiano joined ANTHRAX as
ilead guitarist in 2001, appearing on 2003 album "We've Come For You All" and
i2004's "The Greater Of Two Evils". He was onstage with the band during the
ifamous 2010-2011 "Big Four" tour alongside SLAYER, MEGADETH and METALLICA,
iand
ihe played on and produced ANTHRAX's 2011 critically acclaimed album "Worship
iMusic".

i
iOver the years, Caggiano has also garnered five Grammy nominations as a
irecord producer/guitarist and has worked with a very wide range of artists
iincluding CRADLE OF FILTH, ANTHRAX, VOLBEAT, THE DAMNED THINGS, H20, Jesse
iMalin and even Bruce Springsteen.
i
iWhen Caggiano was enlisted as producer for Danish heavy rock quartet VOLBEAT
iin early 2013, the collaboration was so phenomenally successful that he was
iquickly invited to join the band as well. The resulting album, "Outlaw
iGentlemen & Shady Ladies", achieved major chart success on both sides of the
iAtlantic, as did "Seal The Deal & Let's Boogie".
