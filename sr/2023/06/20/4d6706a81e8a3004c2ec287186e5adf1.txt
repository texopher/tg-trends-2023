irankings of the CBS Sports NBA Draft experts =====

i
iThe finish line is in sight, folks. The 2023 NBA Draft is now just days away,
iand so to celebrate the special occasion, today -- as we do every year --
iwe're releasing the final CBS Sports Prospect Rankings comprised from a
iconsensus of our staff's rankings.
i
iOur final Top 90 is an effort to smooth out outlier views and to paint a
ibroad picture from a high-level perspective of what we think of this class
iwith rankings from yours truly, CBS Sports' Gary Parrish, Matt Norlander,
iDavid Cobb, and Colin Ward-Henninger as well as 247Sports' Adam Finkelstein.
iNot everyone had the same rankings, of course, and there were some experts
ithat were higher and lower on certain prospects -- which we will get to below
i-- but the goal is to give insight and analysis for how we as a staff are
ithinking of the 202 NBA Draft Class.
i
iGenerally speaking, much of our staff thinks of the class in the same way --
iVictor Wembanyama was the consensus No. 1 and Brandon Miller and Scoot
iHenderson were consensus top-four talents -- but everyone comes at the game
ifrom a different perspective and thus can view players either much higher or
imuch lower than the rest. (Norlander, for instance, ranked Duke's Dereck
iLively II as a top-three talent. We'll let him explain his rationale below.)
i

iRankings page
i
i===== Norlander: Why Dereck Lively II is my No. 3 =====
i
iHead on over to my annual big board mock draft to get more of a sense of
iwhere I'm coming from on this. It's key to know I'm projecting LONG-TERM. I
ihave the Duke one-and-doner third on my big board because I think he has a
ihealthy chance at having the third-best career of any player in the 2023
ipool.
iKeep in mind Lively was viewed by some as the best prospect in the high
ischool
iClass of 2022. He was an above-average defender at Duke, and got off to a
islower start because of an offseason injury. I think he adds 15 pounds of
imuscle in the next couple of years, fills out his frame and grows into a good
i3-point shooter. Combine that with his size, high-end defensive ceiling and
ihis fit as a switchable 5, and it's all very tempting.
i
i===== Boone: Why Andre Jackson Jr. is a top-20 prospect =====
i
iThere is lottery buzz surrounding UConn product Jordan Hawkins because of his
isharpshooting, and Huskies big man Adama Sanogo has gotten rave reviews
iduring
ithe pre-draft process as a potential draft pick because of his size and
ishooting, but for my money give me Andre Jackson Jr. long-term over all
ithree.
iHe's a defensive menace whose game projects neatly into the NBA structure
ibecause of his connective-tissue type game and selfless style of play. The
ionly weak spot in his game is his shot -- he hit 28.1% from 3-point range
ilast
iseason -- but he has the requisite size, playmaking and intangibles worth
igambling on to develop into a legitimate NBA rotation player in time. I'm
ibuying all the stock.
i
i===== Cobb: Why I have Gradey Dick at No. 8 =====
i
iDick shot 40.3% from 3-point range on 5.7 attempts per game as a true
ifreshman at Kansas. But he's more than just a shooter. At 6-foot-8, he's long
iand athletic enough to defend multiple positions. He's also adept at
iattacking
iclose-outs by putting the ball on the floor. At just 19, Dick is still early
iin his development, and the fact that his game translated so seamlessly to
ithe
ireigning national champions at the college level is a great omen. That's
iespecially true when you consider how promising former KU wing Christian
iBraun
ilooked during his rookie season with the Nuggets. Braun is more athletic than
iDick, but they played similar roles at Kansas and Dick was a better
icollegiate
i3-point shooter. At worst, Dick will be a 3-point specialist off the bench
ifor
iyears in the NBA. But he's also got the frame, game and intangibles to
idevelop
iinto a fringe All-Star.
i
i===== Finkelstein: The case for Brandon Miller over Scoot Henderson =====
i
iAdmittedly I am conflicted about whether I favor Miller or Henderson. On one
ihand, Miller's size, shooting, passing potential, rate of improvement, and
ieven rebounding are all extremely encouraging, but the lack of rim pressure
iand the struggles he has as a finisher, are concerning. On the other hand,
iScoot's burst, power, explosiveness, instinctual creativity, floor vision,
iand
ipassing are all top notch, but the shooting, defense, and even the subtle
iinconsistencies in that killer instinct he gets credit for give me some
ipause.
iA month ago, I would have said I was 60/40 Miller, but the more intel I
igather
iand the more I revisit the film, the closer this gets for me.
i
i===== Ward-Henninger: The case for Henderson over Miller =====
i
iGiven the current state of the Charlotte Hornets, positional fit should be
iirrelevant with the No. 2 pick in the draft. They need to take the best
iprospect, and that is Henderson -- the type of strong, athletic, dynamic
iguard
iwho tends to have success at high levels in the NBA. I had one source tell me
ithat he wouldn't be SHOCKED if, when all's said and done, Henderson has a
ibetter career than Victor Wembanyama. You just don't hear anyone saying that
iabout Miller, who has more to his game than just "3-and-D," but also has a
imuch longer and more arduous path to superstardom. Even next to LaMelo Ball,
iHenderson will be impactful from Day 1 given his NBA frame and experience
iplaying against grown professionals over the past two years. If I'm the
iHornets, I'm not overthinking this. For two years, Henderson has been second
ito Wembanyama on draft boards for a reason. He's a potential superstar that
iyou're lucky to get at No. 2.
