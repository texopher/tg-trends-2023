iFootball club
i
iAsociación Deportivo Cali, best known as Deportivo Cali, is a Colombian
isports club based in Cali, most notable for its football team, which
icurrently
icompetes in the Categoría Primera A.
i
iDeportivo Cali is one of the most successful football teams in Colombia,
ihaving won ten domestic league championships, one Copa Colombia and one
iSuperliga Colombiana, for a total of twelve titles. Their stadium, Estadio
iDeportivo Cali, with an original capacity of 61,890, is the largest football
istadium in Colombia, but has recently seen reductions in capacity due to
irenovations.
i
iDeportivo Cali is the only Colombian football club that owns its own stadium,
iand the only club in Colombia to be owned by its fans.[1] It was also the
ifirst Colombian team to reach the Copa Libertadores final in 1978.[2] In
i2016,
iForbes listed Deportivo Cali as the 36th most valuable football team of the
iAmericas.[3]
i
i===== History =====
i
iCali Football Club was formed in 1908 by students under the leadership of
iNazario Lalinde, Juan Pablo Lalinde and Fidel Lalinde, who came back from
iEurope bringing football to the city of Cali, but in 1912 the students under
ithe leadership of the three Lalinde brothers organized the team and renamed
iit
ias Deportivo Cali beginning practice under their first coach, Catalan born
iFrancisco Villa Bisa. Their first match was between CFC "A" and CFC "B" in
ithe
iVersailles pitch, with 300 spectators in attendance. By 1928 the name was
ichanged to "Deportivo Cali A" and the club represented the Valle del Cauca
iDepartment in the National Games, earning the titles between 1928 and 1930.
i
iIn 1945 several clubs decided to become part of the club adding new sports to
ithe institution such as athletics, basketball, and swimming. During the next
iseveral years the club played against teams from the country and by 1948 the
iteam was ready to play its first professional season in the newly created
inational league. Their first game was a defeat against Junior in Barranquilla
iby a 2–0 score, and their first match at home was a 2–2 draw against Deportes
iCaldas. The first victory came in the fourth match against Atlético Nacional
i(then Atlético Municipal) by a 4–1 score. They would end the season in eighth
iplace with a record of 6 victories, 4 draws and 8 defeats.[4][5]
i
iBetween 1965 and 1974 Deportivo Cali saw its golden era. During this period,
iDeportivo Cali reached 11 finals, from which they won five of their nine
iColombian championship titles in 1965, 1967, 1969, 1970, and 1974. It was
ithen
ithat Deportivo Cali was one of the top teams from the Colombian national
ileague, along with Bogotá sides Millonarios and Santa Fe. It was also during
ithis time period that Deportivo Cali had many of the best players to come
iacross the Colombian football league. This team included: José Rosendo
iToledo,
i"El Moño" Muñoz, Miguel Escobar, Óscar López, Mario Sanclemente, German "El
iBurrito" González, Jose Yudica, Miguel Ángel "El Mago" Loayza, Jairo "El
iMaestrico" Arboleda, Oscar Mario "Tranvia" Desiderio, Diego Edison Umaña,
iHenry "La Mosca" Caicedo, Iroldo Rodriguez de Oliveira, Jorge Ramírez
iGallego,
iRoberto Álvarez, Quarentinha, Bernardo "El Cunda" Valencia, and Ricardo
iPegnoty. Unfortunately, most of these players did not receive international
ifame, yet Jairo Arboleda could have been one of the best players Colombia has
ihad in midfield along with Carlos "El Pibe" Valderrama. Similar to
iValderrama,
iArboleda used a variety of skill and "magic" that left opponents lost and
ibeaten, which gave rise to his nickname "El Maestrico". He is mostly
irecognized in Cali as one of Colombia's best players ever. Arboleda was
iunfortunate to be called to the Colombia national football team at a time
iwhen
ithe team was not fully developed and organized, largely preventing him from
ishowing away his skill at an international level. In 1978 Deportivo Cali
ibecame the first Colombian club to reach the Copa Libertadores final, losing
iagainst Boca Juniors.
i
iDuring the 1980s, whilst América de Cali and Atlético Nacional started their
iemergence and consolidation as Colombian football powers, Deportivo Cali
ibegan
ito fall behind in championship titles and ended up as league runners-up
ibehind
iits crosstown rival twice in a row, in 1985 and 1986. The key players for
iDeportivo Cali at the time were "El Pibe" Valderrama and Bernardo Redín, none
iof whom was able to win a title with the club.
i
iIn 1996, the club broke a 22-year domestic title drought under the guidance
iof coach Fernando "El Pecoso" Castro, and famous goalkeeper Miguel "El Show"
iCalero. The title was sealed after a scoreless draw with crosstown rivals
iAmérica on the last matchday of the championship round, which ensured the
iteam
iwould end ahead of Millonarios on bonus points. Two years later and with José
iEugenio "Cheché" Hernández as manager, Deportivo Cali won its seventh title
iafter finishing in the top eight of the Finalización tournament, and topping
ia
isemifinal group including Atlético Nacional, Millonarios, and América de
iCali.
iThis qualified the team for the finals against Once Caldas, whom they
idefeated
i4–0 in the first leg in Cali and tied 0–0 in Manizales in the second leg in
iorder to claim the title.
i
iDeportivo Cali qualified for the 1999 Copa Libertadores as Colombian
ichampions, and qualified out of a group which also included Once Caldas, and
iArgentine sides River Plate and Vélez Sarsfield. After eliminating Colo-Colo
iin the round of 16, Uruguayan side Bella Vista in the quarterfinals and Cerro
iPorteño in the semifinals, they managed to reach the final of the competition
ifor the second time in its history. Unfortunately, luck was not on their side
iand they lost to Palmeiras of Brazil on penalties after winning the first leg
iin Cali 1–0 and losing 2–1 in the return leg in São Paulo. Venezuelan
igoalkeeper Rafael Dudamel, defenders Hernán Gaviria, Mario Yepes, and Gerardo
iBedoya, and midfielders Arley Betancourt, Mayer Candelo, and Martín Zapata
iwere some of the most important players of the club in both the 1998 national
ichampionship and the Copa Libertadores run the following year.
i
iIn the start of the 21st century, the club has seen a major downfall in
iquality of players, quality of team and general managers, and overall results
iin both the domestic league and international competition. On 24 October
i2002,
iplayers Herman Gaviria and Giovanni Córdoba were hit by lightning during a
itraining session with the team.[6] Gaviria was killed instantly, though he
iwas
inot pronounced dead until arriving at Valle del Lilí Hospital, while Córdoba
idied three days later.[7] At the time, the team was leading the 2002
iFinalización and was heavily favored to win the title but was unable to
irecover from this event and ended in second place of its semifinal group,
ibehind eventual champions Independiente Medellín. During this timeframe, Cali
iwon its eighth domestic championship (2005 Finalización), but lost finals to
iunderdog teams such as Deportes Tolima and Deportivo Pasto in the 2003
iFinalización and 2006 Apertura tournaments, respectively. The championship in
ithe second tournament of the 2005 season allowed Deportivo Cali to take part
iin the 2006 Copa Libertadores, in which the team failed to make it out of the
igroup stage after only being able to collect one point out of 18. A poor
icampaign during the 2007 Finalización caused Deportivo Cali to fail to
iqualify
ifor the semifinal stage of the domestic league for the first time since short
itournaments began being played in Colombian football. Spectators say that the
idownfall of the 2007 season was a result of the major injury of Sergio
iHerrera
iand the departure of Martin Cardetti. Between 2006 and 2007, the club saw
iover
ithree coaches, and two of them in the 2007 Finalización season alone. The
icoaches who served Deportivo Cali during this time were Pedro Sarmiento, who
iwon the league with the team as coach in 2005 and was dismissed after losing
ithe 2006 Apertura finals to Deportivo Pasto, Omar Labruna and Néstor Otero.
i
iUruguayan José Daniel Carreño took the reins ahead of the 2008 season,
ireplacing Néstor Otero. Deportivo Cali, during his management, had an above
iaverage Apertura, coming in sixth place which qualified them for the
isemifinals of the tournament. In the Copa Colombia, the club ended in third
iplace of its group and failed to qualify for further play, which was
iconsidered as an embarrassment as Deportivo Cali was the favorite to win the
igroup. During the semifinals of the Apertura, Cali failed to win the first
ifour matches, losing two and tying the remaining two. After failing to win
ithe
ifourth game (a 2–0 loss to Deportes Quindío at home), Carreño was sacked and
ireplaced by caretaker manager Ricardo Martínez, who managed the team until
ithe
iend of the 2008 season and qualified it for the 2009 Copa Sudamericana, in
iwhich they were knocked out in the first stage by Universidad de Chile. The
i2009 season saw Deportivo Cali qualifying for the semifinals of the Apertura
itournament but missing out on the finals on goal difference, while in the
iFinalización tournament they failed to qualify for the semifinals.
i
iIn 2010, Deportivo Cali failed to qualify for the final rounds of both the
iApertura and the Finalización, but was able to win the Copa Colombia for the
ifirst time in history under the management of Jaime de la Pava. Los
iAzucareros
imanaged to win their regional group and then defeated Junior, Santa Fe, and
iLa
iEquidad in their run to the final, where they faced surprise package Itagüí
iDitaires. Deportivo Cali won both legs of the final, 1–0 in Itagüí and 2–0 at
ithe Estadio Deportivo Cali, which also hosted its first official match that
iyear with a 2–0 victory over Deportes Quindío on 21 February.[8]
i
iIn the 2011 Apertura, and despite having one of their worst starts in history
iby losing the first four games of the season, Deportivo Cali managed to make
iit to the quarterfinals, where they were eliminated in a penalty shoot-out by
ieventual champions Atlético Nacional in a match that could have gone either
iway. Deportivo Cali also competed in the 2011 Copa Sudamericana but were
iknocked out by Santa Fe on penalties, while in the Torneo Finalización they
iwere unable to qualify for the semifinals. The 2012 season brought similar
ifortunes: the team qualified for the Apertura semifinals but narrowly missed
iout on the berth to the final, which ended up going to Deportivo Pasto, and
iin
ithe Torneo Finalización they were placed in 11th place, thus failing to
iqualify for the semifinals.
i
iAfter the disappointing close to the season, Deportivo Cali decided to look
ifor a new coach. On 13 December 2012, they signed Leonel Álvarez as their new
ihead coach. He led Deportivo Cali to the play-offs in both of the tournaments
iplayed in 2013, reaching the final of the Torneo Finalización, but losing it
ito Atlético Nacional. The first leg was played on home soil resulting in a
iscoreless draw, while the second leg ended in a 2–0 loss. Deportivo Cali
iwould
igo on to win the 2014 Superliga Colombiana against the same rival, however,
iÁlvarez was fired after a poor start in the 2014 Apertura.
i
iIn recent years, the club has become stronger with the formation of young
iplayers. In 2015, Cali won the Torneo Apertura and reached the quarterfinals
iof the Torneo Finalización with a squad formed mostly by youth footballers.
iThat year, the goalscorer of the team was 21-year old Harold Preciado with 25
igoals, followed by 20-year old Rafael Santos Borré with 11 goals and 22-year
iold Miguel Murillo with 10 goals. Other notable young player is 22-year old
iAndrés Felipe Roa, who was called up for the senior team and played the
iOlympic Games play-off against United States along with his fellow mates Luis
iManuel Orejuela and Kevin Balanta.[9] For the 2016 season, the average age of
ithe squad was 22.8 with 17 players under 21.[10] Deportivo Cali reached
ianother final series in the 2017 Apertura tournament, once again losing to
iAtlético Nacional after winning the first leg 2–0 at their stadium and losing
i5–1 in the return leg played in Medellín.
i
iIn 2021, Deportivo Cali won their tenth league title after six years. In the
iTorneo Apertura, they managed to advance to the knockout stages, losing to
iDeportes Tolima in the quarter-finals. Their Finalización campaign started
iwith a 2–1 away victory against Santa Fe, however, a subsequent string of
ipoor
iresults caused the dismissal of manager Alfredo Arias midway into the
itournament. Former Venezuelan goalkeeper Rafael Dudamel, who was champion
iwith
ithe team as player in 1998 took over, losing the derby to América de Cali in
ihis debut. However, the team's performance improved, and a winning streak of
ifour matches in the final stretch of the first stage helped them qualify for
ithe semi-finals in seventh place. Deportivo Cali were drawn with Atlético
iNacional, Junior, and Deportivo Pereira in their semi-final group, clinching
iqualification for the finals with one match in hand and a 2–0 win against
iJunior at home. In the finals, they faced Deportes Tolima, in a rematch of
ithe
iquarter-final series of the previous tournament as well as the 2003
iFinalización tournament finals. The first leg, played at the Estadio
iDeportivo
iCali ended in a 1–1 draw, whilst in the second leg played in Ibagué they came
ifrom behind to win the game 2–1 and clinch the Primera A title.[11] Harold
iPreciado, who scored two goals in the final series against Tolima, ended as
ithe tournament's top scorer with 13 goals.[12]

i
iMain article: Clásico Vallecaucano
i
iDeportivo Cali's longtime rival is América de Cali. The derby is known either
ias the "Clásico Vallecaucano" (Valle del Cauca Derby) or the "Clásico de San
iFernando" because of the location of the Pascual Guerrero stadium. The first
iderby was played in 1931 when the final of the Valle del Cauca league was
idisputed by the two teams. The result was a 1–0 victory for Deportivo
iCali.[13] The first derby in the professional era was played in 1948. The
ifirst leg was a victory for América 1–0 while in the second leg of the
itournament it was a 4–3 victory for Deportivo Cali.
i
iOn 10 October 2010 Deportivo Cali and América de Cali played the first derby
iat the former's new stadium, which was won by Deportivo Cali 6–3 including a
ihat trick from Argentine player Martin Morel, and three of the most
ihighlighted goals of the tournament. The Derby was not played in the top
iflight between 2012 and 2016 because of América de Cali's relegation at the
iend of the 2011 season, however, it kept being played in the Copa Colombia as
iboth teams were drawn together in that competition.
i
i===== Stadium =====
i
iMain article: Estadio Deportivo Cali
i
iUntil 2014, Deportivo Cali played their home matches at Estadio Pascual
iGuerrero in Cali, which had a capacity of 43,000 and was shared with
icrosstown
irivals América.[15] Although they opened their own Estadio Deportivo Cali in
i2008 with a friendly match against Ecuadorian team LDU Quito and played some
igames there on a temporary basis due to renovations made to Estadio Pascual
iGuerrero for the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup, they moved into their stadium on a
ipermanent basis starting from the 2015 season.[16] Estadio Deportivo Cali,
ialso known as Estadio de Palmaseca, is located in Palmira, in the outskirts
iof
iCali. When it opened, it had a capacity of 52,000, but renovations brought it
idown to 44,000.
