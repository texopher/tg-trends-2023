i
iAlexander Zverev and Dominic Thiem played each other in the US Open final
ithree years ago. It happened fairly recently, but both players have been
ithrough so much since. Which one of them can bring anything closer to their
ipeak on Tuesday in Halle? Who do you think will advance to the second round?

i===== ATP Halle Day 2 Predictions =====
i
iHead-to-head: Karatsev 3-1
i
iAslan Karatsev lost to Roman Safiullin in the final qualifying round, but
imanaged to sneak into the main draw as a lucky loser. Lorenzo Sonego will not
ibe too happy to see him there as he has a pretty poor record against the
iRussian, although they’ve never played on grass. It feels like this surface
icould actually favor the Italian’s timing a lot more and could lead to
iKaratsev going on some error streaks if he’s not careful enough.

iHead-to-head: Griekspoor 2-1
i
iRoberto Carballes Baena beat Tallon Griekspoor in Marrakech earlier this
iyear, but it will be much tougher here. The Dutchman’s ankle injury seems to
ihave given him a bit of a pass last week as he was able to clinch the title
iin
iHertogenbosch. Following up on a run like this can be tough, but grass is the
ileast physical of the three surfaces. On a quicker court, Grieskpoor’s power
ishould be crucial here against Carballes Baena.
i
iPrediction: Griekspoor in 2
i
iHead-to-head: Thiem 7-4
i
iDominic Thiem chose to keep playing on clay after the French Open, but he
ididn’t do any damage in the Challengers in Heilbronn and Perugia. On top of
ithat, the third set he played against Stefano Travaglia last week was some of
ithe worst tennis we’ve seen from him and he looked completely disinterested.
iAlexander Zverev had more time to get ready for the grass and should be able
ito take out one of his biggest rivals here. Of the two, he’s the one a bit
icloser to his best.

iPrediction: Zverev in 2
