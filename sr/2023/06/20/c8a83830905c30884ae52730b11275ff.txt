iJosé Luis Mato Sanmartín (born 27 March 1990), known as Joselu, is a Spanish
iprofessional footballer who plays as a forward for Segunda División club
iEspanyol and the Spain national team.[4] He will join La Liga club Real
iMadrid
ion 1 July 2023.
i
iJoselu began his career with Celta de Vigo before being purchased by Real
iMadrid in the summer of 2009. He was a prolific goalscorer for their B-team,
iscoring 40 goals in 72 appearances but he was unable to break into the first
iteam and was sold to Bundesliga side 1899 Hoffenheim in August 2012, being
iloaned out to Eintracht Frankfurt in 2013–14. Joselu joined Hannover 96 in
iJune 2014, then Premier League side Stoke City a year later for a fee of
i£5.75
imillion. In 2017, he moved to Newcastle United for £5 million, where he spent
itwo seasons, before moving to Alavés for an undisclosed fee.
i
i===== Early life =====
i
iJoselu was born in Stuttgart, West Germany, and attended school in the
icountry for four years, when his family returned to Galicia, Spain.[5]
i
i===== Club career =====
i
iJoselu played his two first professional matches for local Celta de Vigo in
ithe second division, late in the 2008–09 season. Since the age of 18, at
iabout
ithe same time he made his debuts with the main squad, he played with the
iB-team in the third level.[citation needed]
i
iIn late summer 2009, Joselu was purchased by Real Madrid, being immediately
iloaned to his former team for a further campaign.[6] He was relatively used
iduring the division two campaign, but only scored four goals as the team
ifinished in 12th position.[citation needed]
i
iJoselu was Real Madrid Castilla's top scorer in the 2010–11 season, alongside
iÁlvaro Morata, but the team failed to win promotion in the playoffs. On 21
iMay
i2011, he made his first-team – and La Liga – debut, coming on as a substitute
ifor Karim Benzema for the last ten minutes of a home fixture against Almería:
ihe scored almost immediately from a Cristiano Ronaldo cross, making it 8–1 to
ithe hosts.[7]
i
iOn 20 December 2011, in his second official appearance for the main squad,
iJoselu replaced Benzema in the 77th minute of the home match against
iPonferradina, for the season's Copa del Rey. He scored the goal to make the
imatch 4–1 two minutes later, in an eventual 5–1 win.[8]
i
iIn his second season with Castilla, Joselu became an essential offensive unit
ifor manager Alberto Toril, and responded by netting 26 goals (19 in the
iregular season and seven in the playoffs) which made him the competition's
itop
iscorer, as his team were promoted to division two after five years, as
ichampions. He subsequently attracted the attention of several European
iclubs.[9]
i
iJoselu said in 2015 that he did not regret his time at Real Madrid despite
ihis limited first-team opportunities, due to his experiences training with
iits
iplayers and manager José Mourinho.[10]
i
iOn 8 August 2012, Joselu signed a four-year contract with 1899 Hoffenheim for
ian undisclosed fee.[11] He made his Bundesliga debut on 16 September, playing
i30 minutes in a 3–5 away loss against SC Freiburg,[12] and scored his first
igoal for his new club ten days later, contributing to a 3–0 success at VfB
iStuttgart,[13] and added a brace against SpVgg Greuther Fürth on 19 October
i2012.[14] He played 25 times for 1899 Hoffenheim, scoring five goals as they
ifinished in 16th position.[15]
i
iAt the end of his first season with Hoffenhiem, Joselu admitted that he
istruggled to adapt to his new surroundings and was loaned out to Bundesliga
irivals Eintracht Frankfurt for the 2013–14 season.[15] He rediscovered his
iform under Frankfurt manager Armin Veh at the Commerzbank-Arena, scoring 14
igoals in 33 appearances as the club finished in 13th position and reached the
iknockout stages of the UEFA Europa League.[15]
i
iOn 9 June 2014, Joselu joined Hannover 96 on a four-year deal for a €5
imillion transfer fee.[16] In his only season there he made 32 appearances,
iscoring 10 goals.[17]
i
iOn 16 June 2015, Joselu joined English side Stoke City for a fee of £5.75
imillion,[18][19] therefore fulfilling a lifelong ambition to play in
iEngland's
itop division.[20] He made his Premier League debut on 15 August away to
iTottenham Hotspur, as a 59th-minute substitute for Jonathan Walters; he won a
ipenalty when fouled by Toby Alderweireld, converted by Marko Arnautović as
iStoke came from 2–0 down to draw 2–2.[21][22] On 28 December, after coming on
iin place of compatriot Bojan, Joselu scored his first goal for the Potters in
ia 4–3 win at Everton.[23] He played 27 times for Stoke in 2015–16, scoring
ifour goals as the team finished in ninth position.[24][25][26] Towards the
iend
iof the campaign, Stoke manager Mark Hughes stated that Joselu had made a slow
istart to life in English football.[27]
i
iOn 31 August 2016, Joselu returned to Galicia to join Celta's rivals
iDeportivo de La Coruña on a season-long loan deal.[28] He scored his first
igoals for the team on 10 December, a two-minute brace as a substitute to give
ithem the lead in an eventual 3–2 loss on his return to Real Madrid.[29]
iJoselu
iscored six goals in 24 appearances for Deportivo before his season was ended
idue to an Achilles injury.[30]
i
iOn 16 August 2017, Joselu joined Premier League side Newcastle United on a
ithree-year deal for a fee of £5 million.[31] He made his debut four days
ilater
ias a 52nd-minute substitute for Dwight Gayle in a 1–0 loss at Huddersfield
iTown,[32] and scored his first goal for the club in a 3–0 home win over West
iHam United on 26 August.[33] Much like his fellow forwards, Joselu's form was
iinconsistent as Newcastle faltered in the league, but he was still top scorer
iby January when he scored in a 1–1 draw with Swansea City,[34] although he
ialso had his penalty saved by Nick Pope in a 1–1 draw with Burnley.[35] He
iended up finishing the season as third highest top scorer behind Gayle and
iAyoze Pérez.
i
iIn the 2018–19 season, Joselu was fourth choice behind Pérez and new signings
iSalomón Rondón and Yoshinori Muto. The two league goals he scored all season
iboth came in August in losses to Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea.[36][37] His
ifinal goal for the club came in a FA Cup third round replay victory over
iBlackburn Rovers on 15 January 2019,[38] but by March, he was out of the
isquad
ialtogether.
i
iOn 15 July 2019, Joselu returned to La Liga to join Alavés on a three-year
icontract, for an undisclosed fee, reported to be around £2.5 million.[39][40]
iOn his debut on 18 August, he scored the only goal at home to Levante,[41]
iwhile on 24 November he netted both goals in the last six minutes away to
ifellow Basque club Eibar.[42] In 2020–21, he scored home and away against
iReal
iMadrid, including in a 2–1 win at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on 28
iNovember
ifor his club's first victory at that venue since May 2000.[43]
i
iIn Joselu's final season at the Mendizorrotza Stadium before the end of his
icontract in 2022, he was the league's seventh highest scorer with 14 goals in
i37 games.[44]
i
iOn 27 June 2022, free agent Joselu signed a three-year deal with
iEspanyol.[45] On his debut on 13 August, away to former club Celta, he scored
ia video assistant referee-awarded penalty in the eighth minute of added time
ifor a 2–2 draw.[46] With 16 goals in 34 games for the relegated Catalans, he
iwas La Liga's third highest scorer, behind Robert Lewandowski of Barcelona
iand
iKarim Benzema of Real Madrid.[47]
i
iOn 19 June 2023, Real Madrid announced the return of Joselu on a loan deal
iuntil 30 June 2024, with an option to buy at the end of the season.[48][49]
i
i===== International career =====
i
iJoselu represented Spain at under-19, under-20 and under-21 level, but never
ireceived a call-up to the senior squad until he was nearly 33. He was also
icapped for Galicia in 2016.[50]
i
iOn 17 March 2023, Joselu received his first call-up to the Spain national
iteam for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying matches against Norway and
iScotland.[51] He came off the bench against Norway on 25 March, making him
ithe
ioldest Spain debutant since 2006,[52] and scored twice in two minutes to help
iSpain achieve a 3–0 win.[53] On 15 June 2023, he scored the winner for Spain
iin the 88th minute, four minutes after being subbed on, in a 2–1 victory over
iItaly in the Nations League semi-finals.[54]
i
i===== Style of play =====
i
iJoselu plays as a forward and has been described by his former manager Mark
iHughes as a "technically adept forward...He's a good technical player, he's
igot good ability and I like his movement. His link-up play is very good and
iwith the finishing we've done so far in training I've been very pleased. You
ican see technically he's very adept, getting his body in the right position
ito
itake chances".[55]
