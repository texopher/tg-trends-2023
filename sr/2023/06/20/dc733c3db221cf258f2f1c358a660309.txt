i
iCarlos Alcaraz admits his chances of winning Wimbledon are “complicated”
iadding that Nick Kyrgios has a better chance of beating Novak Djokovic at The
iChampionships.
i
iDjokovic has been phenomenal at Wimbledon in recent years as he is unbeaten
iin his last 28 matches at SW19 having won the last four titles to take his
igrass-court Grand Slam tally to seven.
i
iThis year he will be looking to draw level with Roger Federer’s Open Era
irecord of eight Wimbledon titles while he will also look to win the third leg
iof a possible Calendar Grand Slam following his successes at the Australian
iOpen and French Open.
i
iAs a result, it is difficult to look past the 23-time Grand Slam winner when
iit comes to this year’s favourite for the Wimbledon title.
i
iAlcaraz will make his third appearance at Wimbledon this year, having lost in
ithe second round on his debut in 2021 while he reached the fourth round last
iyear.
i
iThe Spaniard, who was beaten in the French Open semi-final by Djokovic, is
iconfident in his ability to win tournaments on any surface, but he
iacknowledges that the Serbian on grass is a tough nut to crack.
i
i“Well I have always said that I think I can win any tournament I play,” the
iworld No 2 said. “Obviously, on grass it is a bit more complicated as I don’t
ihave a lot of experience and in the matches I played I struggled on it.
i
i“And obviously [Novak] Djokovic, together with [Roger] Federer, is one of the
igreatest players ever seen on a grass court.
i
i“So, it’s already going to be complicated.”
i
iKyrgios – who finished runner-up at the All England Club last year – was
irecently asked who can stop Djokovic at Wimbledon and he replied: “No one,
ino.
iIf it’s not me, no one.”

i
iAlcaraz, who was beaten in four sets by Jannik Sinner last year, all but
iechoed the Australian’s comments.
i
i“Kyrgios has already played a final in Wimbledon and he’s very good on grass
ias well,” he said.
i
i“I am not saying that I am not capable of beating Djokovic, but I think I
ihave less chances than on other surfaces.
i
i“I think that Kyrgios has more chance to defeat Djokovic than any other
iplayer.”
i
iAlcaraz will kick off his grass-court season at the Queen’s Club
iChampionships this week where he will be the top seed. He will face Frenchman
iArthur Fils in the first round on Tuesday.
