iMore thunderstorms could be rolling across Surrey this week, according to the
ilatest BBC Weather forecast. It comes following a 24-hour storm warning that
iblanketed the county on Sunday (June 18) in which 10 hours of thunder or rain
iwas predicted in places such as Guildford, Woking, and Staines.
i
iIt brought Surrey's mini-heatwave to a shuddering halt, and although much of
ithe county is enjoying glorious sunshine on Monday (June 19) it does not look
iset to last. Thunder and heavy rain is predicted by BBC Weather forecasters
ito
ihit several parts of the county, including Guildford and Walton, on two days
ithis week.
i
iAlthough the predicted stormy weather is slightly at odds with the Met Office
iwhich has forecast thunder on one day this week, and at a different time.
iWeather maps show torrential downpours making their way across the county on
iTuesday morning (June 20) with the possibility of more than 32mm of rain
ifalling within an hour.

ibe a bit better, although the Met Office did warn of further storms.
i
iIt reads: "Sunshine and showers again on Wednesday, with further
ithunderstorms possible. Fewer showers on Thursday. Fine with warm sunshine
ifor
imany southern and eastern parts on Friday, whilst rain arrives elsewhere."
