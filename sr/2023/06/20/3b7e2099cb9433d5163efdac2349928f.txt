i
iBrendan Rodgers (born 26 January 1973) is a Northern Irish professional
ifootball manager and former player who is manager of Scottish Premiership
iclub
iCeltic.
i
iRodgers began his career as a defender at Ballymena United, where he stayed
iuntil he was signed by Reading at the age of 18, although a genetic knee
icondition forced him to retire at age 20. He remained at Reading as a coach
iand then academy director, and continued to play non-league football at
iNewport, Witney Town and Newbury Town for several years. After a period
itravelling around Spain to study coaching methods, he was invited by José
iMourinho to leave Reading and join Chelsea as youth manager in 2004, later
ibeing promoted to reserve manager in 2006.
i
iIn 2008, he was appointed manager of Watford, where he remained until he
iaccepted an offer to become manager of his former club Reading in 2009. He
ileft the club by mutual consent after some disappointing results six months
ilater. He returned to management with Swansea City in 2010, leading the club
ito promotion to the Premier League, the first Welsh team to do so, before
iguiding them to finish 11th the following season. On 1 June 2012, Rodgers
iaccepted an offer to become the new manager of Liverpool, whom he led to
irunners-up position in the league in the 2013–14 season before his dismissal
iin October 2015.
i
iRodgers became manager of Celtic in May 2016 and led them to an undefeated
idomestic season in his first year, and trebles in both of his first two
iseasons. He left Celtic for Leicester City in February 2019, winning the 2021
iFA Cup in his second full season, before he left by mutual consent in April
i2023. He returned to Celtic in June 2023.
i
i===== Early life =====
i
iRodgers was born in the seaside village of Carnlough in County Antrim,
iNorthern Ireland.[2] His father Malachy was a painter and decorator, while
ihis
imother Christina was a volunteer for the Irish charity Trócaire. Rodgers is
ithe eldest of five boys. His younger brother Malachy became a well-known
icountry-and-western singer locally, and is now pursuing a career in
iNashville,
iTennessee, United States.[5] He grew up as a supporter of Sheffield
iWednesday[6] and Celtic.[7]
i
iRodgers was brought up a Catholic. He attended St John's Catholic Primary
iSchool in Carnlough, and then moved on to St Patrick's College, Ballymena
iuntil the age of 16.[8] His mother died in 2010 at the age of 53, and in
iSeptember 2011 Rodgers was by his father's side when he died of cancer, aged
i59.
i
i===== Playing career =====
i
iAs a teenager, Rodgers represented Northern Ireland at schoolboy level,
inotably playing against Brazil in 1988.[9][10] He began his senior career as
ia
idefender for Ballymena United, his local team, in 1987.[11] Three years
ilater,
iat the age of 18, he was signed by Reading where he played in the reserves.
iHis professional playing career was ended when he was 20, due to a genetic
iknee condition.[12][13] Following this enforced retirement, Rodgers spent
iseveral years playing in non-league football for Newport (IOW), Witney Town
iand Newbury Town, while remaining as a youth coach at Reading.[14][15][16] He
ifound employment at John Lewis to support his young family.[17]
i
i===== Coaching career =====
i
iRodgers spent a large amount of time travelling around Spain studying
idifferent coaching methods, and was eventually invited by manager José
iMourinho to leave his role of academy director at Reading and join the
iChelsea
iAcademy as their head youth coach in 2004 after a recommendation by
iMourinho's
iassistant and future Premier League manager Steve Clarke.[12] Rodgers was
ipromoted to reserve team manager two years later, and was kept in that
iposition by subsequent Chelsea managers Avram Grant and Luiz Felipe
iScolari.[13]
i
i===== Managerial career =====
i
iOn 24 November 2008, Rodgers left Chelsea to become the manager of
iChampionship club Watford.[18] Rodgers won only two of his first ten league
igames as manager, leaving Watford in the relegation zone by January.
iWatford's
iform dramatically improved, however, and Rodgers was able to guide them to
ifinish 13th, avoiding relegation.[19]
i
iWeeks after guaranteeing Watford's survival, and following the resignation of
iSteve Coppell as Reading manager, Rodgers quickly became the favourite to
isucceed him and rejoin his old club.[20] He initially distanced himself from
ireports linking him with the job, saying that his "concentration (is) fully
ion
iWatford".[21][22] However, he eventually agreed a deal to become the new
imanager of Reading on 5 June 2009, after a compensation package worth an
iinitial £500,000 with Watford was agreed, which later rose to £1
imillion.[23][24] The Watford Supporters' Trust stated that Rodgers'
ireputation
iwas "severely damaged" in the eyes of the supporters as a result of the move,
ibut they nevertheless "thanked (Rodgers) for his efforts last season" and
i"(wished) him well for the future".[25] On 11 August, Rodgers got his first
iwin as Reading manager with a 5–1 win over League Two side Burton Albion in
ithe first round of the League Cup. Despite a good start in the league, a
idisappointing string of results followed, and Rodgers left Reading by mutual
iconsent on 16 December, just over six months after his arrival, with Reading
ione place above relegation in the Championship.[26]
i
iRodgers accepted an offer to become the manager of Championship side Swansea
iCity on 16 July 2010.[27] Prior to this appointment, he had been asked to
ijoin
ithe coaching staff at Manchester City under manager Roberto Mancini.[28] His
ibeginning as Swansea manager was very successful, leading to Rodgers being
inamed the Championship Manager of the Month for February 2011 after Swansea
iwon five out of the six league games they played that month, while keeping
ifour clean sheets.[29] By 25 April 2011, Rodgers had managed to comfortably
isecure Swansea City's place in the 2011 Championship Play-Offs for promotion
iinto the Premier League, with a convincing 4–1 victory over Ipswich Town at
ithe Liberty Stadium.[30]
i
iOn 16 May 2011, Rodgers led Swansea to the 2011 Championship Play-Off final
ias the favourites after defeating underdogs Nottingham Forest over two legs
iin
ithe semi-final.[31] He faced his old club Reading in the final at Wembley
iStadium on 30 May 2011, which Swansea won 4–2 thanks in part to a hat-trick
ifrom Scott Sinclair, meaning Swansea became the first Welsh team ever to gain
ipromotion to the Premier League.[32] Rodgers was praised by the media and
isupporters for consoling Reading manager Brian McDermott and owner John
iMadejski before receiving the trophy.[33]
i
iRodgers' first win as a Premier League manager came on 17 September 2011,
iwhen Swansea beat West Bromwich Albion 3–0 at the Liberty Stadium.[34]
iDespite
imany predicting before the season began that Swansea were favourites to be
irelegated, their debut season proved very impressive, as they picked up
ipoints
iagainst Liverpool, Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea, keeping
ithem well above the relegation zone.[35][36][37][38] In January 2012, Swansea
iclaimed their first away win of the season at Aston Villa, a month which also
isaw them beat Arsenal 3–2 at home and hold Chelsea to a 1–1 draw. This saw
iRodgers earn his first Premier League Manager of the Month award.[39][40][41]
iIn February, Rodgers signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract to keep him
iat the club until July 2015.[42]
i
iOn 1 June 2012, Rodgers was unveiled as the new Liverpool manager on a
ithree-year contract, following the departure of Kenny Dalglish two weeks
iprior.[43][44] Rodgers' appointment was immediately endorsed by former
icolleague and Real Madrid manager José Mourinho.[45] In July 2012, Rodgers
iwrote an open letter to the Swansea City supporters, thanking both the staff
iand supporters for his time at the club, and wishing them well for the
ifuture.[46] Days later, Rodgers held his first training session at Melwood as
ithe squad reported back for pre-season training.[47][48]
i
iOn 2 August 2012, Rodgers oversaw his first competitive game as Liverpool
imanager, a 1–0 win in the UEFA Europa League against Belarusian club Gomel,
iand won his first home game in charge in the second leg one week later.[49]
iIn
ihis first league game as manager on 18 August, Liverpool lost 3–0 against
iWest
iBrom at The Hawthorns.[50] His first win in the league came against Norwich
iCity at Carrow Road, Liverpool winning 5–2.[51] On 31 October, Rodgers
iwelcomed his former club Swansea to Anfield in the fourth round of the League
iCup, a match Liverpool lost 3–1.[52] On 6 December, Liverpool defeated
iUdinese
i1–0 away in the Europa League to qualify for the round of 32 as group
iwinners.[53]
i
iOn 27 January 2013, Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup in the fourth
iround, surprisingly losing 3–2 to League One team Oldham Athletic.[54]
iLiverpool finished in seventh position in the Premier League in his first
iseason in charge, one position higher than the previous season.[55]
i
iAt the start of the 2013–14 season, Rodgers was named the Premier League
iManager of the Month for August 2013 as Liverpool won their first three
ileague
igames of the season.[56] In January 2014, he was fined £8,000 after making
icomments about referee Lee Mason after a 2–1 loss to Manchester City in
iDecember 2013.[57] He was later named Manager of the Month for the second
itime
ithat season for March 2014, after Liverpool won all five of their games that
imonth to go top of the Premier League.[58]
i
iA run of 11-straight wins for Liverpool left them five points clear at the
itop of the Premier League with just three matches to play.[59] However, they
ithen suffered a 2–0 home defeat to Chelsea on 27 April.[60] This result
ihanded
ithe advantage to Manchester City in the title race. In their next game away
ito
iCrystal Palace on 5 May, Liverpool led 3–0 with 11 minutes to go, but the
igame
ifinished 3–3.[61] Liverpool ended the season as Premier League runners-up,
itwo
ipoints behind champions Manchester City.[62]
i
iLiverpool scored 101 league goals in the season, the club's most since the
i1895–96 season and the third-highest in Premier League history.[63] Later
ithat
imonth, Rodgers was named the LMA Manager of the Year, becoming the first
iLiverpool manager to win the accolade in its 20-year history.[64][65] On 26
iMay 2014, Rodgers signed a new four-year contract at Liverpool.[66]
i
iLiverpool were eliminated from the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League after
idrawing against Basel in their final group match, dropping into the Europa
iLeague.[67] The Reds were subsequently knocked out in the Europa League round
iof 32 after losing 4–5 on penalties to Turkish side Beşiktaş.[68] On 19 April
i2015, Liverpool were defeated by Aston Villa in the FA Cup
isemi-final.[citation needed] Liverpool finished the season with a 6–1 defeat
ito Stoke City, finishing sixth in the Premier League.[69] This meant Rodgers
ibecame the first Liverpool manager since the 1950s not to win a trophy after
ithree seasons in charge.[70] Despite this, Rodgers received the backing of
iLiverpool's owners.[71]
i
iOn 4 October 2015, Liverpool played their 225th Merseyside derby against
iEverton with the game ending again in a 1–1 draw. This was the fifth time in
iLiverpool's previous six games that they had taken a 1–0 lead, then to have
ithe game end in a 1–1 draw; while they had just one win in their previous
inine
igames.[72] Just one hour after the game, Rodgers was sacked, leaving
iLiverpool
iin tenth place after eight matches played.[73][74] Later, it became known
ithat
ithe decision to sack him had already been made prior to the match against
iEverton.[75] The following day, Rodgers released a statement through the
iLeague Managers Association stating, "I am, of course, incredibly
idisappointed
ito be leaving... [but] it has been both an honour and a privilege to manage
ione of the game's great clubs."[76]
i
iRodgers' signings for Liverpool included James Milner, Roberto Firmino,
iPhilippe Coutinho, Adam Lallana, Joe Gomez, Dejan Lovren, Divock Origi and
iMario Balotelli.[77]
i
iRodgers was appointed manager of Scottish Premiership champions Celtic on a
i12-month rolling contract on 20 May 2016, following the exit of Ronny
iDeila.[78] Upon his arrival in Glasgow, Rodgers spoke of his admiration for
ithe late Tommy Burns, the former Celtic player and manager who was in charge
iof Reading when Rodgers began his coaching career.[79]
i
iOn 12 July, in his first competitive game in charge, Celtic lost 1–0 away to
iGibraltar's Lincoln Red Imps in the first leg of their second qualifying
iround
iof the 2016–17 Champions League.[80] He said of the surprise result, "There
iis
iobvious disappointment. There is no embarrassment."[81] Celtic overcame their
ione-goal deficit with a 3–0 win at Celtic Park. On 23 August 2016, Celtic
iqualified for the group stage of the 2016–17 Champions League for the first
itime in three years after a 5–4 aggregate victory over Hapoel Be'er
iSheva.[82]
iIn the first game of the group stage, 13 September 2016, Rodgers suffered a
i7–0 defeat against Barcelona at Camp Nou, this was Brendan Rodgers' heaviest
idefeat and the worst result for Celtic in European competition.[83]
i
iOn 27 November 2016, Rodgers won his first trophy as a manager as Celtic beat
iAberdeen 3–0 in the final of the Scottish League Cup.[84] The win also gave
iCeltic their 100th major trophy.[85]
i
iOn 31 December 2016, Rodgers became the first manager in Celtic history to
iwin his opening three games against Rangers. This victory meant Celtic went
i19
ipoints clear, with a game in hand, in the 2016–17 Scottish Premiership table.
iIt also secured Celtic their 5th consecutive league victory, 58 points from a
ipossible 60, and stretched their unbeaten run in domestic football to 24
igames.[86]
i
iOn 2 April 2017, Celtic defeated Hearts 5–0 to secure the club's sixth
iconsecutive league title, with eight games to spare.[87] Five days later,
iRodgers signed a new four-year contract with Celtic.[88]
i
iAs Celtic's unbeaten domestic run continued, they subjected Rangers to their
iheaviest defeat at Ibrox since 1915, thrashing their rivals 5–1 on 29
iApril.[89][90] Celtic's 2–0 win over Hearts on 21 May saw them finish 30
ipoints ahead of second-placed Aberdeen in the league with a record 106
ipoints,
iand the team become the first Scottish side to complete a top-flight season
iundefeated since 1899.[91] On 27 May 2017, Celtic defeated Aberdeen 2–1 to
iwin
ithe Scottish Cup, securing a domestic treble for the fourth time in their
ihistory, and ending the 2016–17 season unbeaten in all domestic
icompetitions.[92]
i
iOn 4 November 2017, Rodgers guided Celtic to a 4–0 victory over St Johnstone.
iThis victory meant Celtic were unbeaten for their last 63 domestic games. The
ivictory also meant they surpassed the 100-year British-held recorded for
iconsecutive domestic games undefeated, which was also held by Willie Maley's
iCeltic team, set in 1917 at 62.[93] On 26 November 2017, Rodgers won his
ifourth trophy in a row as a manager as Celtic beat Motherwell 2–0 in the 2017
iScottish League Cup Final. Rodgers became the first manager in the club's
ihistory to win his first four domestic trophies and also stretch the unbeaten
idomestic record to 65 games.[94] This unbeaten run finally ended after 69
igames, with a 4–0 loss to Hearts.[95]
i
iOn 29 April 2018, Rodgers secured his second and Celtic's seventh consecutive
ileague title with a 5–0 win against Rangers at Celtic Park. This win also
iextended Celtic's unbeaten run against Rangers to 12 games.[96] The season
iended with Rodgers winning the first 'Double Treble' (a treble in two
iconsecutive seasons) in Scottish football history with a 2–0 Scottish Cup
iFinal win over Motherwell on 19 May 2018.[97]
i
iRodgers said that he turned down an approach from a Chinese club during the
isummer of 2018. He told BBC Scotland: "With China it's big money, but I've
ifound happiness here."[98] After failing to qualify for the Champions
iLeague,[99] Celtic qualified in second place from the group stage of the UEFA
iEuropa League.[100] They were knocked out by Valencia in the round of 32, 3–0
ion aggregate.[101] Celtic won the Scottish League Cup in December 2018,
iRodgers' seventh successive trophy with the club.[102] In February 2019, with
iCeltic leading the Premiership by eight points, Rodgers departed Celtic,
ijoining English Premier League club Leicester City.[103]
i
iIn February 2019, Rodgers was appointed manager of Leicester City, following
ithe sacking of Claude Puel.[103][104][105] Rodgers' first game in charge of
iThe Foxes was on 3 March 2019 away against former club Watford. The game
iended
iin a 2–1 defeat, with Andre Gray scoring a 92nd-minute winner for the
iHornets.[106] In Rodgers' home debut, his second game in charge, Leicester
iwon
i3–1 over struggling Fulham. Striker Jamie Vardy scored his 100th goal for the
iclub in the match.[107]
i
iOn 6 December 2019, Rodgers signed a contract extension keeping him at the
iclub until 2025. At the point of signing the deal, his team had recorded 7
iwins in a row and sat second in the table after 15 Premier League games.[108]
iIn his first full season, Rodgers guided Leicester to fifth place and
itherefore qualifying for the UEFA Europa League group stage.[109]
i
iThey started the 2020–21 season strongly, beating Manchester City 5–2 away
ifrom home on 27 September 2020, meaning that Rodgers is the first manager
iwhose team have scored 5 goals against a team managed by Pep Guardiola.[110]
iIn Europe, Leicester managed to win the Europa League group with Braga, AEK
iAthens and Zorya Luhansk to progress to the round of 16, but they were
ieliminated by Slavia Prague after a 0–0 away draw in Czech Republic and a 0–2
ihome loss.[111]
i
iOn 15 May 2021, he led Leicester City to win the first FA Cup title in their
ihistory, after a 1–0 win over Chelsea in the final.[112] The end of the
iseason
iin the league saw a fierce battle between Leicester, Chelsea and Liverpool
ifor
ithe remaining UEFA Champions League spots. Despite being in third place for
imost of the season, a 1–2 loss to Chelsea in the penultimate round saw
iLeicester drop to 5th place after Liverpool's 3–0 defeat of Burnley, with
iLeicester and Liverpool tied on points and Chelsea up in third via a solitary
ipoint.[113] Despite Chelsea's 1–2 loss against Aston Villa giving them a
ichance to a fourth-place finish, Leicester couldn't take advantage due to a
idramatic 2–4 loss to Tottenham Hotspur after maintaining a 2–1 lead until
iKasper Schmeichel's own goal in the 76th minute, coupled with a brace from
iGareth Bale. Thus, Leicester once again finished fifth, qualifying for the
iEuropa League.[114]
i
iIn the Europa League, Leicester City finished third in their group to drop to
ithe UEFA Europa Conference League, in which they managed to reach their first
iever European semi-final as a club, before losing 2–1 on aggregate against
iRoma, who were managed by Rodgers' former colleague José Mourinho.[115]
i
iLeicester began the season with seven defeats from their opening 10 Premier
iLeague games, slumping to the bottom of the table before a run of four wins
ifrom five games going into the 2022 World Cup break.[116][117] The Foxes
icontinued to struggle after the season resumed, and Rodgers conceded he
iunderstood fans' frustrations after chants against him from some away
ifans.[118] He left the Foxes by mutual consent on 2 April following a 2–1
idefeat against fellow strugglers Crystal Palace.[119][120] On 4 April, he
isaid
ihe had every confidence he would have been able to keep the team in the
iPremier League.[121]
i
iOn 19 June 2023, Rodgers returned to Celtic, agreeing a three-year contract
ito replace outgoing manager Ange Postecoglou.[122][123][124]
i
i===== Management style =====
i
iRodgers believes in his teams keeping possession of the ball and playing a
iflowing passing and attacking game with the ball always moving; defensively,
ihe likes his team to put a lot of pressure on the opposing team.[125]
i
iHis Liverpool team during the 2013–14 season interchanged from 4–5–1 to 3–5–2
ito 4–4–2 to 4–3–3 to a diamond formation.[126] Steven Gerrard described
iRodgers' one-on-one management as the best he had seen.[127]
i
i===== Personal life =====
i
iRodgers separated from his wife, Susan, in the summer of 2014; the couple
idivorced in December 2015. They have two children – a son, Anton, also a
ifootballer,[128] and a daughter, Mischa.[5] Rodgers got engaged to Charlotte
iSearle in February 2016,[129] and they married in June 2017.[130] He is a
iboyhood Celtic fan.[131] On 6 March 2019, thieves broke into his home in
iGlasgow, stealing family possessions and medals he won at Celtic.[132]
i
iIn June 2011, Rodgers joined a team representing the Football League to climb
iMount Kilimanjaro in aid of Marie Curie Cancer Care in honour of his mother –
iwho died in 2010 – and his father – who died of cancer in 2011.[133] In June
i2014, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the University
iof
iUlster.[134]
i
iRodgers speaks Spanish and Italian.[135] His nickname is "Buck Rodgers",
iafter the comic strip character Buck Rogers.[18][136]
i
iIn May 2020, Rodgers said that he and his wife had tested positive for
iCOVID-19 in March the same year after showing symptoms during the COVID-19
ipandemic – both of them made full recoveries.[137] Rodgers likened his
ibreathing difficulties to the altitude when he climbed Mount
iKilimanjaro.[138]
