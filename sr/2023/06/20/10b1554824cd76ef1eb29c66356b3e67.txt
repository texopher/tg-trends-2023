iLuis Enrique appears to be on the verge of becoming Paris Saint-Germain.
iReports suggest that the Spanish manager will have a say in the transfer
itargets, and it seems heâ€™s scratching off one potential file: Marcus Thuram.
i
iLa Gazzetta dello Sport reported that Enrique is less of a fan of Thuram,
iunlike the German manager Julian Nagelsmann. The France international has
iasked for a few days to contemplate his future since AC Milan is also in the
irace to sign him.
i
iThe Serie A side reportedly has a â‚¬5.5 million per season offer on the table
ifor Thuram to come to Italy. If Enrique doesnâ€™t see Thuram as a viable option
iin his tactical, then AC Milan could be receiving a significant boost to land
ithe forward.

ientraÃ®neur du PSG. Marcus Thuram a demandÃ© quelques jours pour rÃ©flÃ©chir Ã

iCurrently, thereâ€™s no concrete information as to who Enrique will want at the
istriker position. Nonetheless, the former FC Barcelona manager reportedly
idoes
iwant some players with uncertain futures at PSG.
i
iEnrique reportedly wants Neymar to remain in the French capital, considering
iheâ€™s one of the managers that the Brazilian has played his best under the
i53-year-old during his time with the Catalan side.
