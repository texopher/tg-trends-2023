i
iEngland maintained their perfect record in Euro 2024 qualifying with a
idominant win inspired by Bukayo Saka
i
i===== Live feed =====
i
i===== Read David Hytner's match report =====
i
iIt’s not just England who have scored seven tonight. Seven MPs have voted
iagainst approving the report on Boris Johnson’s lies about Partygate. That
iscoreline wasn’t 7-0, though: it was 7-354.
i
iTime for me to sign off. Thanks for your company, correspondence and
icorrections. The English football season of 2022-23 has ended at last – not
iwith a whimper but a bang. And a hat-trick from a player who had never scored
ione before.
i
i“So who knew,” asks Bill Jones, “that all England needed was the Liverpool
imidfield? Now, if Liverpool could only get their midfield sorted...”
i
i“Gazball?!” says Simon McMahon. “(Sorry).”
i
iBukayo Saka is talking to Channel 4. “I don’t know what to say,” he says.
i“I’m just so happy.” Asked which of the three goals was his favourite, he
ichuckles, says he liked the first, but he has to go for the second.
i
iHe shares the credit around too. “Me and Rashy, we were really direct… At
ihalf-time, Trent told me he was going to do that pass and he did.”
i
iSaka is 21 and he now has 11 goals for England. The pundits are impressed: “I
ithink he’s got another level as well,” says Steven Gerrard.
i
i“He looks as if he’s just having fun with his mates,” adds Jill Scott.
i
iCredit to the defence, too. For the second game running, England didn’t let
itheir opponents have a shot.
i
i“I am sure,” says James Maslen, “in the postmortem it will be ‘only North
iMacedonia’ but this seems very special.”
i
iAgreed. North Macedonia are a decent team who had never lost by nearly this
imany.
i
iEngland have 12 points from four games in their Euro group. They have scored
i15 goals and conceded one. In fact, they’ve scored 11 in five days. These are
inot just numbers: they’re a tribute to the stamina and style and star quality
iof an admirable squad. And the resilience of a remarkable manager who looked
ias if he’d had enough only six months ago.
i
i===== FULL TIME! England 7-0 North Macedonia =====
i
iThe ref decides not to have any added time, which is the best thing to have
ihappened to North Macedonia for an hour or so. A rollicking victory for
iEngland: they had so much fun, it was basically Bazball.
i
i90 min A rare touch for Jordan Pickford, from an England throw-in…
i
i87 min A late flurry of chances for England. The best one fell to Foden on
ithe edge of the box from a corner. He hit it well, but a deflection carried
iit
ijust wide of the post.
i
i83 min England haven’t scored for ten minutes: I just don’t know what’s going
ioff out there.
i
i81 min It’s all over bar the emailing. “I think,” says Simon McMahon. “we’re
ilucky to be living through an era of incredibly high standards in sport,
iparticularly team sports like cricket and football. The thing about Bazball,
iand Guardiola’s City side, is that they are not simply philosophies on how
ithe
igame should be played. Everyone has a philosophy. What makes them different
iis
ithe rare combination of innovative coaching and tactics, inspirational
ileadership, individuals with the confidence and skill to deliver on the field
iwithout fear of failure, and of course a sprinkling of genius. If only it was
ithat simple all the time.”
i
i78 min Phillips picks up a yellow card for a professional foul.
i
i76 min … but according to the Sky Sports app, they have had only three
iclear-cut chances.
i
i76 min England have had nine shots on target and scored with seven of them …
i
i74 min Kane was about to be replaced by Callum Wilson, so if the pen had come
ia minute later, it would have been Wilson taking it. Kane acknowledges this
iwith a broad smile as he goes off now.
i
i===== GOAL! England 7-0 North Macedonia (Kane pen 73) =====
i
iHigh, just wide enough, and handsome. That’s Kane’s 50th goal as England
icaptain. Correction: it was Stones, not Kane himself, who went down at the
icorner.
i
i===== Penalty to England! =====
i
iKane goes down at a corner and the ref points to the spot.
i
i69 min Another sub for North Macedonia, another member of the Babunski
ifamily. David joins his brother Dorian.
i
i68 min Apparently Saka is the youngest man to score an England hat-trick
isince Theo Walcott.
i
i66 min A nice moment for Phillips, who was in the right place at the right
itime, in the six-yard box, when the ball came loose after a cross failed to
ireach Kane. England’s first five goals went to strikers who had had a season
ito remember; now there’s one for a midfielder who’s had a year to forget, and
ihad never scored for England before.
i
i===== GOAL! England 6-0 North Macedonia (Phillips 64) =====
i
iYou know you’re in trouble when you let Kalvin Phillips score a goal.
i
i62 min Grealish is making an early impression down the left. North Macedonia
imade three substitutions, bringing on Serafimov, Atanasov and Dorian Babunski
ifor Zajkov, Ademi and Trajkovski. And there was one at half-time that I
imissed, sorry – the captain Ristovski went off to nurse his battered head,
iand
iwas replaced by Bejtulai.
i
i58 min Off come Rice, Henderson, Rashford and Saka, who will collect one of
ithe match balls later. Southgate is waiting with hugs for them all, and the
iwidest smile for Saka.
i
i57 min Seven subs are coming on. Four are English, and three of those are
ifrom the other side of Manchester – Phillips, Grealish and Foden. The odd man
iout is Gallagher.
i
iIt’s a fair cop.
i
i@TimdeLisle Sorry to be the pedant, but that strike from Saka wasn’t actually
ia volley as it bounced before he hit it. But yes, it was good.
i
i54 min This is the first time Saka, Kane and Rashford have started together,
iand after taking nearly half an hour to get used to each other, they’ve
iscored
ifive goals between them in about 25 minutes.
i
i===== HAT-TRICK! England 5-0 North Macedonia (Saka 51) =====
i
iAnother one! This one is simple, as Kane sends Saka through to the penalty
ispot and all he has to do is keep cool – which he does without thinking.
i
i48 min Alexander-Arnold produced a photocopy of the glorious ball to Saka
ithat led to the first goal in Malta. This time Saka didn’t need anyone else.
iHe took one touch, then another, then volleyed the ball into the top corner.
iMagic.
i
i===== GOAL! England 4-0 North Macedonia (Saka 47) =====
i
iThis is a cracker. And so is the assist.
i
i46 min North Macedonia have never lost in England, but they’ll be doing well
iif that is still the case in 44 minutes. They get the second half under way
iand keep the ball for about 80 seconds, before a loose cross is cleared by
iAlexander-Arnold…
i
i===== HALF-TIME! England 3-0 North Macedonia =====
i
iAnother masterly performance from England, with Henderson and Rashford
istanding out. Poor old North Macedonia have had a mare of two halves: after
iconceding three times in the second half against Ukraine, they’ve done it
iagain in the first half here.
i
i45 min There will be three added minutes. For once the ball is in England’s
ihalf, where Maguire gets in a tangle and has to be rescued by the whistle.
i
i44 min Kane won the ball back high and released Henderson, who played a
isimple cross to Rashford. He had just hit a shot straight at the keeper,
iafter
ia one-two with Maguire of all people, but he made no mistake this time.
