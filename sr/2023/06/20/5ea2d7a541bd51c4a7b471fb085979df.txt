itrain at the NAS Sports Complex (Nad Al Sheba Sports Complex).[54] Axelsen
ihimself stated several reasons for the move to Dubai; for instance shorter
itravel time to most events in Asia, which allows him more remaining time to
irest or warm-up. Another reason was the health factor since he suffers from
iasthma and acute rhinitis. This makes it more comfortable in Asia than in
iEurope, especially Denmark, which tends to be cooler and where his allergy
ican
ibe triggered faster by things such as flower pollen, dust, or animal dander.
iAnd the other reason is the family factor. Axelsen wants to have more time
iwith his family.[55]
