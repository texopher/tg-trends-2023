iBarcelona forward Ansu Fati is adamant he will remain at Camp Nou despite
ireported interest from Manchester United.
i
iFati, 20, has caught the eye of many since he burst onto the scene at the
iCatalan club. However, the left-sided winger saw his game time reduced last
iseason as Xavi led Barca back to the La Liga title.
i
iDespite making 51 appearances in all competitions, Fati came on mainly as a
isubstitute which led to anger from his father Bori. In March, he told Spanish
iradio station Cadena Cope: "I don’t have an answer for that [why his son was
inot playing] either and he as a coach will have his reasons.
i
i"Maybe he thinks he lacks things like defending and I understand that. I as a
ifather am angry, yes. Maybe I’m not right, but I don’t have a problem with
ithat."

i
iWhen asked about Fati's dad's outburst, Xavi declared he was not interested
iabout his concerns. "He [Fati] is calm and focused," the former central
imidfielder said.
i
i"I only care about him, not his father or his entourage. I have also lived
ithrough similar situations, he is suffering for his son and I understand
ihim."
i
iWith all this noise surrounding his playing time, alternative clubs were
ibeing floated around as potential alternative destinations. United were
iincluded in these reports, as were Arsenal.
i
iBut, Fati appeared to put the rumours to bed in a recent interview. Speaking
ito Teledeporte about his future, the winger said: "I have a contract with
iBarca and my intention is to continue improving and growing there.
i
i"That is my intention. I have a contract and I’m happy. Both in my club and
iin the national team."
i
iFati featured for Spain on Sunday as they won the Nations League against
iCroatia. After a goalless 120 minutes, Dani Carvajal converted the winning
ipenalty in the shootout to secure a 5-4 victory.
