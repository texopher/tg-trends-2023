iPatrick James Cummins (born 8 May 1993) is an Australian international
icricketer who captains the Australian cricket team in Test and ODI
icricket.[4]
iA right-arm fast bowler, he is currently regarded as being among the best
ibowlers in Test cricket.[5][6][7] As of January 2023, Cummins is rated as the
inumber one bowler in the world in the ICC test bowling rankings. Cummins was
ia
imember of the Australian team that won the 2015 Cricket World Cup, 2021 ICC
iT20 World Cup, and was the winning captain of the 2023 ICC World Test
iChampionship final.
i
iCummins made his Test debut at the age of 18 in 2011. Injuries then forced

i2017. After the completion of the 2019 cricket season, Cummins was awarded
iboth the Allan Border Medal for best Australian cricketer of the year and was
inamed the ICC Test cricketer of the year.
i
i===== Early life =====
i
iCummins grew up in Mount Riverview in the Blue Mountains with his two
ibrothers and two sisters.[8] He attended St Paul's Grammar School.[9] As a
ichild he idolised Brett Lee, with whom he later briefly played domestic and
iinternational cricket.[10][11]
i
iAt the age of three, Cummins lost the top of his middle finger on his
idominant right hand when his sister accidentally slammed a door on it.[12]
i
iCummins played junior cricket for the Glenbrook-Blaxland Cricket Club in the
iBlue Mountains before playing first-grade cricket for Penrith District
iCricket
iClub in 2010.[13] That same year, Cummins represented NSW in the National
iUnder-17 championships and later the NSW Under-19 side.[14]
i
i===== Early career =====
i
iIn the preliminary final of the 2010–11 KFC Twenty20 Big Bash against
iTasmania, Cummins took 4 for 16 and was named Man of the Match.[15] He
ifinished as the equal leading wicket-taker in the tournament.[16]
i
iIn March 2011, Cummins made his first-class debut against Tasmania, aged 17.
iHe returned figures of 2/80.[1] Cummins played the final three matches of the
i2010/11 Sheffield Shield season, including the final where he bowled 65 overs
ifor the match. He was later ruled out of the Australia A tour of Zimbabwe due
ito a back injury.[14]
i
i===== International career =====
i
iCummins was granted a Cricket Australia contract in June 2011[17] and in
iOctober 2011, he played two Twenty20 International (T20I) and three One Day
iInternational (ODI) matches for Australia against South Africa, claiming ten
iwickets and subsequently being selected in the Australian Test squad to play
iSouth Africa.
i
iCummins made his test match debut at Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg in
iNovember 2011, in what was only his fourth career first-class match,[18]
ibecoming Australia's youngest Test cricketer since Ian Craig in 1953, aged 18
iyears and 193 days.[19] Cummins took 1/38 and 6/79, becoming the second
iyoungest test cricketer (behind Enamul Haque Jr.) to take six wickets in an
iinnings.[20] He then scored 13 runs in the second innings, including a four
ito
iwin the match and was presented with the Man of the Match award.[21]

iChampions League, but was diagnosed with a stress fracture in his back upon
ihis return to Australia in November, again ruling him out of the 2012/13 home
isummer.[14]
i
iCummins returned for Australia A in August 2013, but a reoccurrence of the
istress fracture in his back caused him to miss the majority of the 2013/14
isummer.[23] He returned to the BBL in January 2014 after working with Dennis
iLillee during his layoffs to re-shape his bowling action.[14]
i
iAfter prioritising white ball cricket during 2014, Cummins was selected in
ithe Australian squad for their successful 2015 World Cup campaign, playing in
ifour matches.
i
iCummins was a late call-up for 2015 Ashes squad after the retirement of Ryan
iHarris, but he was not selected for a test during the series. He was part of
ithe ODI and T20I series in the same tour. During the ODI leg of the tour,
iCummins' stress fracture resurfaced and he was ruled out of the entire home
isummer for the fourth time in five years.
i
iCummins made his return to domestic cricket in 2016, becoming a key member of
ithe New South Wales one day squad and the Sydney Thunder as he remained fit
iand played 25 matches in just over 4 months.[14]
i
iOn 7 March 2017, Cummins played in the Sheffield Shield for the first time in
isix years, his last match being the 2011 final against Tasmania. He bowled 36

iongoing Border Gavaskar Trophy and Cummins was selected as his replacement
ifor
ithe third test.

iAfter 1946 days (or 5 years, 3 months and 27 days) of absence due to various
iinjuries, Cummins returned to test cricket on 16 March 2017. He alleviated
iany
ifears over his injury history, bowling 79 overs in the final two Test
imatches.[14]
i
iCummins retained his spot in the side for the 2017–18 Ashes series, taking 23
iwickets, leading the wicket taking tally. He also established himself as a
ihandy lower order batter, scoring two scores in the 40s during the series as
iAustralia was victorious 4–0.
i
iCummins scored his first test half-century in the fourth test against South
iAfrica during Australia's tour of South Africa in 2017–18.[25] In this
iseries,

ibowlers, playing in all four matches and claiming 22 wickets.[26] He was then
irested for the tour of the UAE vs Pakistan in October 2018 as he managed a
iback injury.
i
iHe returned for the 2018/19 test series against India, claiming 14 wickets in
ifour tests in a beaten Australian side.[27]
i
iIn January 2019, Cummins became one of Australia's two test vice-captains,
ialongside Travis Head.[28] He played in both tests against the touring Sri
iLankans and was the chief architect of Australia's innings win in the first
itest at the Gabba, taking his maiden 10-wicket haul. He finished the series
iwith 14 wickets and was named as the player of the series.
i
iCummins was awarded the Allan Border Medal in February 2019 as the most
ioutstanding Australian cricketer over the previous 12 months.[29] He was the
ifirst bowler to receive this honour since 2014, and just the fourth overall.
iIn early 2019, Cummins became the world's number 1 ranked test bowler, the
ifirst Australian since Glenn McGrath to achieve this.[30]
i
iHe played in the limited-overs series against India which began in the same
imonth,[31] taking a five-wicket haul in the fourth ODI of the series.[32] In
iApril, he was named in Australia's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup held
iin England,[33][34] and during the tournament played in his 50th ODI.[35]
i
iHe went on to play in the 2019 Ashes series which followed the World
iCup.[36][37] In the first test he claimed his 100th test wicket, the fastest
iAustralian since World War II to do so.[38] After the second test at Lords,

ihighest by an Australian.[39] Cummins was the leading wicket-taker for the
iseries, taking 29 wickets in the five matches, at an average of

iwas named as the 2019 ICC Men's Test Cricketer of the Year.[42]
i
iIn February 2020, Cummins took his 100th wicket in ODI cricket, in the first
imatch of Australia's tour of South Africa.[43]
i
iDuring the 2020/21 Border Gavaskar Trophy Cummins claimed a series-leading 21
iwickets at an average of 20.04, and was named player of the series despite
iAustralia suffering a 2–1 loss.[44]

iAustralian Test cricket team following the resignation of Tim Paine. Steve
iSmith was announced as his vice-captain, marking Smith's return to a
ileadership position after the 2018 ball-tampering scandal.[48] Cummins was
ithe
ifirst fast bowler to take on the role of full-time Australian captain in
ihistory. He took seven wickets in his first test as captain during the first
imatch of the 2021–22 Ashes series, including a five wicket haul in the first
iinnings, a first for an Australian seam bowling captain.[49] Despite being
iabsent from the 2nd test of the series after being a close contact of a
iCOVID-19 case at a Adelaide restaurant,[50] Cummins was the leading
iwicket-taker for the third consecutive Ashes series, with 21 wickets in 4
imatches. Under his captaincy, Australia defeated England 4–0.
i
iUnder the captaincy of Pat Cummins, Australia toured Pakistan after 24 years
isince their last visit in 1998. Cummins was a leading wicket taker in the
iinaugural Benaud-Qadir Trophy series along with Nathan Lyon. He picked 12
iwickets across three Test matches with a 22.50 bowling average. Cummins took
ihis seventh 5-wicket haul in the first innings of the third Test match in

iafter Aaron Finch retired from ODI cricket,[51]
