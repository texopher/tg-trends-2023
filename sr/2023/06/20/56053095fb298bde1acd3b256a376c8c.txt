i
iUkraine's long-awaited counter-offensive to retake territory from Russia's
ioccupying forces is under way.
i
iHere are the latest developments:
i
i===== Ukraine counter-offensive under way =====
i
iUkraine has confirmed it has started "counter-offensive and defensive
iactions" after an escalation in fighting in the south and east of the country
isparked speculation about the widely anticipated push.
i
iOfficials claim to have taken seven settlements in the eastern Donetsk region
iand at least 90 sq km (35 sq miles) since starting their counter-offensive
iearlier this month.
i
iThe BBC has been granted access to some of the settlements now flying the
iUkrainian flag but found many were deserted, and in some areas Russian forces
iwere pushing back.
i
iUkrainian officials also claim to have made advances around what is left of
ithe eastern city of Bakhmut - most of which is under Russian control after
ithe
ilongest and possibly bloodiest battle in the war.
i
iUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that there was
i"movement forward" and thanked Ukrainian troops for "every step and every
imetre of Ukrainian land that is being liberated from Russian evil".
i
iHowever, Russia's President Vladimir Putin insisted Ukraine had not succeeded
i"in any of the sectors" and that Ukraine had suffered "catastrophic" losses -
ialthough he did not offer any evidence.
i
iNato chief Jens Stoltenberg said that while it was still "early days",
iprogress was being made in repelling Russian troops.
i
iAnalysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) have also
iconcluded that Ukraine has continued to make "limited territorial gains".
i
i===== Russia steps up missile attacks =====
i
iIn anticipation of Ukraine's counter-offensive Russia stepped up missile and
idrone attacks in recent weeks and those have continued.
i
iTwelve people have died after missile strikes on Kryvyi Rih - President
iZelensky's home city - on 13 June and a further three people were killed on
i14
iJune in a rare attack on the Black Sea port of Odesa, which is vital to
iUkraine's grain exports.
i
iKyiv has also been targeted again in recent weeks, leading to several deaths
iincluding that of an 11-year-old girl on 1 June, although Ukraine says many
iof
ithe attacks on its capital and other regions have been prevented - or at
ileast
ilimited - by its air defences.
i
i===== Cross-border attacks into Russia =====
i
iVladimir Putin's latest statements on the progress of the war did include one
iadmission - that authorities in Moscow could have better anticipated recent
icross-border attacks into Russia from Ukraine.
i
iRussia blamed the deaths of two women in the village of Maslova Pristan in
ithe border region of Belgorod on 2 June on shelling by Ukrainian forces and
isaid others had been injured.
i
iThe shelling came nearly two weeks after Moscow said 70 attackers who crossed
ithe border from Ukraine had been killed, adding that they were Ukrainian
ifighters.
i
iKyiv denied involvement and two Russian paramilitary groups have said they
iwere behind the incursion.
i
iThe claims by the warring sides have not been independently verified, but any
iassaults on Russian soil make Nato leaders nervous, and the development could
iprove a mixed blessing for Ukraine.
i
i===== Dam flood rescue efforts continue =====
i
iMeanwhile, humanitarian efforts continue to help people affected by severe
iflooding in southern Ukraine, following 6 June's major breach of the Kakhovka
idam on the Dnipro River.
i
iSeveral towns and villages along the banks - and the city of Kherson which
ihad a population of more than 270,000 before the war - were among those hit,
iwith tens of thousands of people told to leave their homes.
i
iHowever, the UN says Russia "is yet to provide the safety guarantees we need
ito cross the front line to the left bank of the Dnipro River".
i
iUN humanitarian co-ordinator for Ukraine Denise Brown adds it is engaging
iwith both Ukrainian and Russian governments to reach anyone who may "urgently
irequire life-saving assistance".
i
iThe death toll from the flooding in the Russian controlled areas of the
iKherson region reached 17 on 13 Jan, according to the head of the
iMoscow-installed government there.
i
iUkraine said on 12 June that 10 people had been killed in areas it controlled
iand another 42 were missing.
i
iEach side has blamed the other for the destruction of the dam in
iRussian-controlled territory, but BBC correspondent Paul Adams says the
ievidence overwhelmingly suggests it was Russia's doing.
i
iThere are also concerns that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been
iaffected - or has the potential to be affected - by the dam breach
idownstream.
i
iThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said there was no immediate
inuclear safety risk and it was monitoring the situation - but a visit by the
ihead of the UN's nuclear watchdog scheduled for 14 June has been delayed.
i
i===== More than a year of fighting =====
i
iRussia's invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over
iUkraine before dawn on 24 February 2022.
i
iRussian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control
iof large areas of Ukraine.
i
iThey had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv, and controlled much of the
inorth-east of the country around Sumy.
i
iRussian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the
ieast and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol.
i
iBut, they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced
iserious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering
ishortages of food, water and ammunition.
i
iUkrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the
iNlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian
iadvance.
i
iMore Western arms followed and by October the picture had changed
idramatically - having failed to take Kyiv, Russia had withdrawn completely
ifrom the north.
i
iUkraine had its first major success, pushing Russia back from Kharkiv, and
icounter-attacking around Kherson and eventually regaining control of the
icity.
i
iMore than a year since the invasion, Ukraine is now hoping its latest
icounter-offensive can turn the war in its favour.

i
i===== About these maps =====
i
iTo indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are
iusing daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with
ithe American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project.
i
iTo show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using daily
iupdates from the UK Ministry of Defence and BBC research.
i
iThe situation in Ukraine is fast moving and it is likely there will be times
iwhen there have been changes not reflected in the maps.
