iKylian Mbappé set another record as France stretched their 100% start in
iEuropean Championship qualifying Group B with a 1-0 win over Greece in Paris.
i
iMbappé’s 55th-minute penalty was his 54th goal of the season and took him
iclear of Just Fontaine to become the top French scorer in a single club and
iinternational campaign. But there was an air of fortune about his winner
iafter
iOdysseas Vlachodimos palmed away his initial penalty only for the referee to
ispot an infringement and order the kick to be retaken.

i
iRandal Kolo Muani and Jules Koundé also had good chances for France while
iGreece’s task became harder after Konstantinos Mavropanos was sent off for a
ifoul on Kolo Muani in the 69th minute.
i
iIn the same group Ireland took 52 minutes to break through Gibraltar’s
idefence before goals from Mikey Johnston, Evan Ferguson and Adam Idah secured
ia 3-0 win in Dublin.
i
iIn Group C, Ukraine could count themselves lucky to strengthen their hold on
isecond place behind free-scoring England, who brushed aside North Macedonia
i7-0. The Ukrainians laboured against the bottom side Malta in Trnava, and it
itook a fortuitous 72nd-minute penalty from Viktor Tsygankov to eke out a 1-0
iwin.
i
iIn Group D, Armenia also had a stroke of fortune as it took an injury-time
ipenalty from Tigran Barseghyan to claim a 2-1 win over Latvia and build on
ithe
iweekend’s stunning win over Wales in Cardiff. Daniel Hakans scored a
ihat-trick
ias Group H leaders Finland made it four wins out of five with a comfortable
i6-0 win over San Marino. Slovenia and Denmark shared a 1-1 draw in Ljubljana,
imeaning Kazakhstan jumped into second place courtesy of Abat Aymbetov’s
i88th-minute strike that gave them a shock 1-0 win over Northern Ireland in
iBelfast.
i
iSwitzerland lost their 100% record in Group I after they were pegged back by
itwo late goals at home to Romania. The Swiss looked set to be coasting to a
ifourth straight win after two first-half goals from Zeki Amdouni. But Romania
ihit back, reducing the deficit through Valentin Mihaila in the 89th minute
ibefore the same player struck again to snatch a point two minutes into injury
itime.
