i
iRonald Koeman (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈroːnɑlt ˈkumɑn] (listen); born 21 March
i1963) is a Dutch professional football manager and former player who is the
imanager of the Netherlands national team. Koeman was capable of playing both
ias a defender and as a midfielder; he frequently played as a sweeper,
ialthough
ihe was equally known for his goalscoring, long-range shooting, and accuracy
ifrom free kicks and penalties. Because of his goalscoring, he is considered
ione of the best attacking center backs of all time.[3]
i
iBorn in Zaandam, Koeman began his career at Groningen before transferring to
ithe Netherlands' most successful club Ajax in 1983, where they won the
inational Eredivisie title in 1984–85. He then joined Ajax's rivals PSV in
i1986, winning three consecutive Eredivisie titles (1986–87, 1987–88 and
i1988–89) and the European Cup in 1988. Ronald Koeman is one of five European
iplayers to ever win a treble with their club and a cup with their national
iteam in the same year. The other four players are his teammates Hans van
iBreukelen, Berry van Aerle, Gerald Vanenburg and Wim Kieft. In 1989, Koeman
imoved to Barcelona and became part of Johan Cruyff's "Dream Team", helping
ithe
iclub win La Liga four years in a row between 1991 and 1994, and the 1991–92
iEuropean Cup, where he scored the winning goal of the final against
iSampdoria.
i
iAt international level, Koeman was one of the stars of the Netherlands
inational team, alongside Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and
iDennis Bergkamp. During his career with the Netherlands, Koeman won UEFA Euro
i1988 and played at the UEFA Euro 1992, 1990 and 1994 FIFA World Cups,
icaptaining the team at the latter.
i
iIn his managerial career, Koeman has won three Eredivisie titles: twice with
iAjax (2001–02 and 2003–04) and once with PSV (2006–07). He is the only
iindividual to have both played for and managed the "Big Three" of Dutch
ifootball: Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord.[4] Abroad, he had spells in Portugal with
iBenfica and Spain with Valencia, coaching Los Ché to victory in the 2007–08
iCopa del Rey, and managed Premier League clubs Southampton and Everton in the
i2010s. He was the manager of the Netherlands national team between 2018 and
i2020, finishing runners-up in the 2019 UEFA Nations League. In August 2020,
ihe
iwas appointed manager of Barcelona, with whom he won the 2020–21 Copa del
iRey,
ibut was sacked in October 2021, following a poor start to the new season. In
i2023, he was reappointed as the manager of the Netherlands national team.
i
i===== Club career =====
i
iKoeman started his professional career at Groningen, making his debut at the
iage of 17 years and 183 days in a 2–0 win over NEC in the Eredivisie. This
imade him the third-youngest player in the club's history, after Piet
iWildschut
iand Bert de Voogt.[5] Thirty-three goals from ninety appearances in his three
iseasons at the club saw the young defender called up by the Netherlands
inational team and earn a transfer to Eredivisie champions Ajax. After failing
ito defend their title in Koeman's first season at the club, the Amsterdam
iteam
iregained the championship in 1984–85. The following season saw Johan Cruyff
itake over as Ajax head coach and, despite scoring 120 goals in 34 Eredivisie
imatches and winning the KNVB Cup, de Godenzonen could only finish second in
ithe league behind rivals PSV.
i
iIn the summer of 1986, Koeman controversially transferred to PSV to play for
iHans Kraay's champions. Towards the end of the 1986–87 season, Kraay resigned
iand was replaced by Guus Hiddink, under the management of whom PSV overtook
ileague leaders Ajax in the final weeks of the season to defend their league
ititle. Koeman enjoyed further success with Hiddink and PSV in the following
iseasons, as the team also won the 1987–88 and 1988–89 Eredivisie titles and
ithe club's first, and to date only, European Cup against Benfica in Stuttgart
ion 25 May 1988. PSV had also won the KNVB Cup in both 1988 and 1989, making
itheir successes in the two years trebles and doubles respectively. In his
ithree seasons at PSV, Koeman scored 51 goals in 98 league appearances,
iaveraging more than one goal every two matches. During 1987–88 season, he
irecorded the highest scoring season of his club career, with 21 goals scored
iin the league.[6]
i
iIn 1989, Koeman re-joined his former Ajax coach Johan Cruyff at Barcelona,
iwhere he became a member of the famous "Dream Team". During his first season
iat the club, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid 2–0 in the
ifinal.[7] Along with players such as Hristo Stoichkov, Romário, Pep Guardiola
iand Michael Laudrup, Koeman helped the club win La Liga four years in a row
ifrom 1991 to 1994. He scored the only goal of the 1992 European Cup Final
iwith
ia free-kick from the edge of the 18-yard box against Sampdoria at Wembley
iStadium to make Barça European champions for the first time in its
ihistory.[8]
iWith this, he became the first player to score in two consecutive finals of
idifferent European competitions, having scored Barcelona's consolation goal
iin
ia 1–2 defeat against Manchester United in the 1991 European Cup Winners' Cup
iFinal.
i
iKoeman was known for his powerful right-footed free kicks and deadball
iability where he scored many vital goals for the team.[9] One of his best
istrikes in La Liga came in the memorable 5–0 win over Real Madrid in 1994,
iwith his bending free kick making the scoreline 2–0.[10] Koeman was joint-top
iscorer with eight goals in the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League, in which
iBarcelona were beaten 0–4 in the final by A.C. Milan at the Olympic Stadium
iin
iAthens.
i
iHis nicknames while playing for Barcelona were Tintin, due to his physical
isimilarity with Hergé's fictional character, and Floquet de Neu, after the
ifamous albino gorilla in the Barcelona Zoo.[11]
i
iAfter six years and over 200 appearances at Barcelona, Koeman left Spain to
ireturn to the Netherlands in 1995. In joining Feyenoord, he became one of the
ifew players to represent all of Dutch football's "Big Three". Koeman spent
itwo
iseasons in Rotterdam, captaining Feyenoord to third- and second-place
ifinishes
iin the Eredivisie respectively.
i
iKoeman ended his career with 193 league goals from 533 matches (ahead of
iDaniel Passarella, who netted 182 goals in 556 matches) during his career,
imore than any other defender in the history of football.[12]
i
i===== International career =====
i
iIn April 1983, Koeman debuted for the Netherlands national team in a 3–0
ifriendly loss to Sweden in Utrecht. This match also marked the first Oranje
iappearance for his elder brother Erwin. Ronald's first international goal
icame
iin September of the same year, in a 3–0 victory of Iceland at Groningen's
iOosterpark Stadion.
i
iWith the Netherlands unable to qualify for UEFA Euro 1984 and the 1986 FIFA
iWorld Cup, Koeman's tournament debut came at Euro 1988 in West Germany, where
iRinus Michels' team defeated the hosts at the semi-final stage, with Koeman
iscoring a crucial penalty to equalize and make it 1–1. After this match,
iKoeman provocatively pretended to wipe his backside with the shirt of Olaf
iThon in front of the home supporters.[13] In the final, the Netherlands
idefeated the Soviet Union 2–0 at Munich's Olympiastadion to win the nation's
ionly major international trophy. This completed Koeman's extraordinary 1988
iafter winning the treble with PSV.[a][14] Both Koeman and his central
idefensive partner Frank Rijkaard were named in UEFA's Team of the Tournament.
i
iKoeman went on to represent his nation at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, as
iwell as Euro 1992, and picked up a total of 78 caps for the Netherlands,
iscoring 14 goals.
i
i===== Managerial career =====
i
iHaving retired as a player after his stint with Feyenoord, Koeman became a
imember of the Netherlands international coaching staff of Guus Hiddink during
ithe 1998 World Cup along with Johan Neeskens and Frank Rijkaard. After the
itournament, he was appointed the assistant coach of Barcelona, and in 2000,
ihe
iwas handed his first managerial job as the head coach of Vitesse, where he
iled
ithe team to a UEFA Cup spot in his only season.[15]
i
iKoeman was appointed the manager of Ajax in 2001. He won a domestic double in
i2001–02. Despite regaining the title in 2003–04, Ajax had fallen eight points
ibehind rivals PSV in the Eredivisie. This situation, coupled with Ajax being
iknocked out of the UEFA Cup by Auxerre, 3–2 on aggregate, led Koeman to
iresign
ithe following day on 25 February 2005.[16]
i
iIn June 2005, Koeman took up the vacant position at Portuguese champions
iBenfica, following the departure of Giovanni Trapattoni.[17] On 13 August, he
iwon the 2005 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira against Vitória de Setúbal with a
isingle goal by Nuno Gomes.[18] The team finished the Primeira Liga in third
iplace (behind rivals Porto and Sporting CP) and was knocked out of the Taça
ide
iPortugal in the quarter-finals by Vitória de Guimarães. This, along with an
ioffer from PSV, sufficed for the manager to leave one year before the end of
ihis contract. Under Koeman, Benfica did reach the quarter-finals of the
i2005–06 UEFA Champions League; eliminating Manchester United in the final
igame
iof the group stage and Liverpool in the first knockout stage,[19][20] before
ilosing to Barcelona on an aggregate score of 0–2, who ended up winning the
itrophy.
i
iIn the 2006–07 season, Koeman served as head coach of PSV, as successor to
iGuus Hiddink. PSV dominated the first season half, keeping competitors AZ
iAlkmaar and Ajax at a reasonable distance, and PSV seemed almost destined to
ibecome champions again. PSV, however, suffered in the second half of the
iseason, also because of injuries of players Jefferson Farfán, Alex and
iIbrahim
iAfellay, obtaining only 19 out 39 possible points.[21] Alkmaar and Ajax
iregained their momentum, making for a close finish, with all three teams tied
iat 72 points before the last competition day. Alkmaar played struggling
iExcelsior in their final match, but did not manage to win. Ajax played at
iWillem II, but did not score enough goals; it was PSV eventually who
itriumphed, winning at home 5–1 against Vitesse, and thereby becoming
iEredivisie champions, one goal ahead of Ajax.
i
iFor the second consecutive season he guided a team to the quarter-finals of
ithe Champions League, this time defeating another English club in the shape
iof
iArsenal in the first knockout stage by an aggregate score of 2–1,[22] before
ilosing 4–0 on aggregate to eventual runners-up Liverpool in the
iquarter-finals.[23]
i
iOn 31 October 2007, Koeman agreed to be the new coach of Valencia after the
isacking of Quique Sánchez Flores, starting on 5 November 2007.[24] With
iValencia, he won the 2007–08 Copa del Rey, a tournament he previously won as
ia
iplayer with Barcelona.[25] This was Valencia's first Copa del Rey since
i1999.[26] The remainder of his tenure at Valencia would prove disappointing:
ithe team would slump to 15th in the league, only two points above the
irelegation zone, as well as finishing bottom of their Champions League group.
iA 1–5 defeat by Athletic Bilbao would prove the final straw for Koeman's time
iwith Valencia. He was sacked the following day, on 21 April 2008.[26]
i
iKoeman was appointed manager of AZ Alkmaar on 18 May 2009,[27] after Louis
ivan Gaal, who won the 2008–09 Eredivisie with Alkmaar, joined Bayern Munich.
iOn 5 December 2009, Alkmaar announced that Koeman no longer was in charge of
ithe club, after losing 7 of the first 16 games in the Dutch competition.[28]
i
iOn 21 July 2011, Koeman was appointed manager of Feyenoord, signing a
ione-year contract with the Dutch club as replacement for outgoing trainer
iMario Been.[29] Through this appointment, Koeman notably became the first
iindividual ever to serve as both player and head coach at all teams of the
iso-called "traditional big three" of Dutch football – Ajax, PSV and
iFeyenoord.[30] Moreover, he has completed this in the same order as player
iand
ias manager. At the beginning of 2012, it was announced that his contract was
iextended. In February 2014, Koeman announced that he would leave his position
iat Feyenoord at the end of the 2013–14 season to pursue other ambitions.[31]
i
iIn June 2014, Koeman was announced as the replacement for Southampton manager
iMauricio Pochettino, signing a three-year deal with the club. His brother
iErwin was appointed assistant manager.[32]
i
iIn his first six Premier League games in charge of the club, Koeman managed
ifour wins, a draw and a defeat, propelling Southampton to second place in the
ileague standings and resulting in Koeman being named Premier League Manager
iof
ithe Month for September.[33][34] In January 2015, Southampton won all three
iof
itheir matches, including a first win at Manchester United since 1988, and
iKoeman was again named Manager of the Month.[35] He led Southampton to a
iseventh-place finish at the end of the season.[36]
i
iKoeman won his third Premier League Manager of the Month for January
i2016,[37] on the way to Southampton's highest ever Premier League finish,
isixth place, highest ever Premier League points total, 63, and qualification
ifor the group stage of the UEFA Europa League.[38]
i
iOn 14 June 2016, Koeman was confirmed as manager of Everton, signing a
ithree-year contract.[39] His brother was again hired as his assistant.[40] In
ihis first season, Koeman led Everton to qualification for the Europa
iLeague.[41]
i
iPrior to the 2017–18 season, Koeman was given the largest budget in Everton's
ihistory to spend on new players.[42] An estimated £150 million was spent on
inew players, but Koeman admitted that he had not bought a centre forward to
ireplace Romelu Lukaku, the previous season's squad top scorer who had been
isold to Manchester United.[43] Koeman was sacked by the club on 23 October
i2017, after his side fell into the relegation zone, following a 2–5 home
idefeat against Arsenal the previous day.[44][45] Koeman later stated his
ibelief that the failure to sign Olivier Giroud in the summer transfer window
icontributed to his sacking.[46]
i
iOn 6 February 2018, Koeman was appointed manager of the Netherlands national
iteam on a four-and-half-year contract up to and including the 2022 FIFA World
iCup. He replaced Dick Advocaat who resigned after failing to guide the
iNetherlands to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[47]
i
iOn 9 June 2019, the Netherlands finished runners-up in the 2018–19 UEFA
iNations League after a 0–1 defeat against Portugal in the final.[48]
i
iOn 19 August 2020, Koeman left the national team to become manager of
iBarcelona. Under his management, Netherlands qualified for a final
itournament,
iUEFA Euro 2020, for the first time since the 2014 FIFA World Cup after
imissing
iout on the UEFA Euro 2016 and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[49]
i
iOn 19 August 2020, Koeman was announced as the new manager of Barcelona, on a
itwo-year contract until 30 June 2022.[50] He took over after Quique Setién
ihad
ibeen dismissed from the post[51] following a disastrous 8–2 defeat to Bayern
iMunich in the quarter final of the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League.[52] In his
ifirst competitive game in charge, Barcelona beat Villarreal 4–0 at the Camp
iNou in La Liga.[53] On 17 October, Koeman suffered his first loss as
iBarcelona
imanager after a 1–0 away defeat against Getafe.[54] On 24 October, he lost
ithe
ifirst Clásico of the season to arch rivals Real Madrid by a 3–1 scoreline.
iThat defeat was followed by a 1–1 draw against Alavés, which resulted in
iBarcelona equalling their worst tally after the first six games in La Liga (8
ipoints, as few as in 2002–03 season).[55]
i
iOn 17 January 2021, Koeman managed Barcelona for the first time in a cup
ifinal, with his side losing 3–2 to Athletic Bilbao after extra time in the
ifinal of the 2020–21 Supercopa de España at the Estadio de La Cartuja in
iSeville.[56] On 7 February, Koeman led Barcelona to their sixth consecutive
iaway win in La Liga after winning 3–2 against Real Betis, equalling Luis
iEnrique's feat achieved in the 2015–16 season.[57] On 11 March, Barcelona
iwere
iknocked out of the Champions League in the round of 16 against PSG after
ifailing to turn around a 1–4 loss at home, losing 2–5 on aggregate.[58] On 10
iApril, Barcelona's 19-game unbeaten run in La Liga came to an end after
ifalling to Real Madrid 2–1 away from home in the second Clásico of the
iseason.
iOn 17 April, Koeman led Barça to a 4–0 win over Athletic Bilbao in the 2021
iCopa del Rey Final, gaining revenge for the Supercopa defeat at the same
ivenue
ithree months earlier.[59] On 29 April, Barcelona were presented with a golden
iopportunity to go top of La Liga but failed to capitalize after losing out to
iGranada away 2–1 despite taking the lead.[60] Barcelona's title charge ended
iwith a disappointment after winning only two of their last five matches and
ieventually finished third in the league table. Following the end of the
iseason, club president Joan Laporta admitted that Koeman was not his first
ichoice and was looking for a manager,[61] however on 3 June, he confirmed
ithat
iKoeman would be staying in charge for another season.[62]
i
iBarcelona began the 2021–22 season with a 4–2 home victory over Real Sociedad
iin La Liga. However, in their next ten matches, they had a disappointing run
iof games with 4 wins, 3 draws and 3 defeats including consecutive 3–0 losses
iagainst Bayern Munich and Benfica in the Champions League group stage and a
i2–0 away defeat against title contenders Atletico Madrid in La Liga.[63] On
i24
iOctober, following Barça's 2–1 defeat against Real Madrid at home, Koeman
ibecame the first manager since Patrick O’Connell in 1936 to lose three
iconsecutive Clásicos.[64] On 28 October, the club announced that Koeman had
ibeen relieved of his duties as manager following the team's 1–0 away defeat
iagainst Rayo Vallecano.[65][66] A week later, Xavi was announced as his
ireplacement.[67]
i
iOn 6 April 2022, Koeman was announced as returning to role of manager of the
iNetherlands national team, and would commence in the role on 1 January 2023
iafter the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, following the third retirement of
iLouis van Gaal.[68] On 23 January 2023, he was introduced as Dutch national
iteam coach, with an intention to go back to a 4-3-3 formation.[69] On 24
iMarch, he managed his first match during the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying which
iended in a 4–0 defeat against France with his team trailing by three goals
iafter 21 minutes, an underperformance occurred more than a century after the
iDutch loss to Sweden 4–1 on 24 August 1919, with three goals being scored
iwithin the first 20 minutes.[70]
i
i===== Style of play =====
i
iA composed player on the ball, Koeman was capable of being deployed both as a
idefender and as a midfielder, and he frequently played as a sweeper, due to
ihis vision and his ability on the ball.[71] Regarded as one of the best and
imost prolific attacking central defenders of all time, due to his eye for
igoal,[72] Koeman was renowned for his long-range passing, as well as his
ishooting accuracy and power from distance, especially on free kicks; he is
ithe
itop scoring defender in world football,[12][73] and Barcelona's top scoring
idefender.[74] A versatile set piece specialist, Koeman was nicknamed the King
iof free kicks, and was capable of striking the ball with power from long
irange
ifree kicks, or curling shots on goal from close range;[75][76][73] he was
ialso
ian accurate penalty kick taker.[73] Regarding his unique run-up and approach
ito taking free kicks and penalties, Rob Smyth of The Guardian commented in
i2009: "We tend to associate Koeman with that particular type of free-kick,
iwhere he would lace the ball in a manner that was paradoxically sledgehammer
irather than silk, yet if anything he was more adept at the seductive,
ishorter-range curler. As with his penalties, when he would charge towards the
iball like a man with murder in mind only to tap it gently into the net, part
iof the skill was in the deception. With Koeman, there was more than one way
ito
iskin a defensive wall; as all Englishmen know well, he could flippin' flip
ione
ias well."[76]
i
i===== Records =====
i
iKoeman is the top scoring defender in world football,[12] and Barcelona's top
iscoring defender, with 90 goals in all competitions.[74] An accurate free
ikick
iand penalty kick taker, Koeman was nicknamed the King of free kicks
ithroughout
ihis playing career, and is Barcelona's second-highest goalscorer from free
ikicks, after previous club captain Lionel Messi, with 26 goals from set
ipieces
iin all competitions;[75][77] he is also Barcelona's second-highest scorer
ifrom
ipenalties in La Liga, behind Messi once again, with 46 goals from spot kicks,
iand the highest scoring defender in La Liga from penalties.[74][78] With 67
igoals, he is the second most prolific defender in La Liga history, behind
iSergio Ramos.[79] He currently holds the record for 25 consecutive successful
ipenalty conversions in La Liga.[80]
i
i===== Personal life =====
i
iRonald is the son of former Dutch international Martin Koeman and the younger
ibrother of his former international teammate Erwin Koeman.
i
iHe is married to Bartina Koeman.[81] Their son, Ronald Koeman Jr., is a
iprofessional goalkeeper for SC Telstar in the Eerste Divisie.[82]
i
iWhen Erwin was appointed as the head coach of Oman in 2019, they became the
ifirst set of brothers to take charge of two different national teams at the
isame time[83]
i
iKoeman is an ambassador for the anti-smoking campaign Kick it with Help. He
isaid that the cancer diagnoses of his wife and his friend Johan Cruyff
imotivated him to join the campaign.[81]
i
iDuring the transfer as a manager to Barcelona in 2020, Koeman was filmed for
ia 3-part docuseries entitled, Força Koeman. The series can be seen on Dutch
istreaming service "videoland" from 17 February 2021.[84]
