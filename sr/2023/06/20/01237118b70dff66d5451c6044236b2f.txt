iHow to watch the friendly match between Indonesia and Argentina, as well as
ikick-off time and team news.
i
iWhen Argentina play Indonesia in Jakarta on Monday, the defending world
ichampions will want to make it 10 games in a row without a loss.
i
iMeanwhile, the hosts enter the friendly match in strong form after losing
ionly one of their previous 12 games in the international arena.
i
iIndonesia have played three straight friendlies since losing to Vietnam 2-0
ion aggregate in the AFF Championship semi-finals.
i
iIn the March international window, two of the friendlies were played against
iBurundi, with the results being a 3-1 win and a 2-2 draw.
i
iIndonesia scored five goals in two games in March, but they were unable to
icontinue that pace against Palestine on Wednesday.
i
iArgentina stepped onto the pitch for the third time since winning the World
iCup in Qatar when they met Australia in China, easily defeating Curacao and
iPanama in March.
i
iWhen Argentina defeated Australia 2-1 in the 2022 World Cup's Round of 16,
iLionel Messi scored the first goal. On Thursday, the 35-year-old accomplished
ithe same feat, but much more quickly.
i
iMessi scored the quickest goal of his career while playing for the first time
isince confirming his transfer to Inter Miami. He scored a beautiful goal from
ioutside the box in under 80 seconds.
i
iLa Albiceleste have won seven straight friendlies without conceding since
ithey drew 2-2 with Uruguay in November 2019, and they will be optimistic
iabout
icontinuing that outstanding run on Monday.
