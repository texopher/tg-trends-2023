iColdplay is heading to Singapore in January, and news of the "Music of the
iSpheres" concert is generating equal parts excitement among fans and fury
iwith
iwhat people are describing as Ticketmaster failures.
i
iColdplay is slated to play four dates in January 2024 at the National Stadium
iof Singapore, which has a capacity of about 55,000 people.
i
iPre-sales for the concert started on Monday at 10 a.m. SGT, per a tweet from
ithe concert organizer, Live Nation Singapore. About 1 million virtual
iTicketmaster queue numbers were issued in total, local newspaper The Straits
iTimes reported.
i
iShortly after ticket sales opened, many disappointed fans started taking to
iTwitter to express their anger and dismay at Ticketmaster, saying they were
iexperiencing frozen screens and were unable to select tickets.
i
iOne Twitter user wrote that he was faced with a blank screen once he entered
ithe website, despite his relatively good queue number of 7,679.

i
iAnother person said he was met with a webpage with no option to buy tickets
idespite the long wait, and was eventually kicked out of the queue. His
ioriginal queue number of 50,000 was over 700,000 when he clicked back into
ithe
iqueue.

i
iAnother person described a disappointing ticketing experience after she was
ikicked out of the queue — despite being on the page 30 minutes before the
isales started. She shared a video showing she was unable to purchase any
itickets in the end, with every section marked as sold out.

iDue to the overwhelming demand, Live Nation Singapore has announced that the
iBritish rock band will be adding a fifth date to its Singapore stop. Tickets
ifor the new date are slated to go on sale on Tuesday at 10 a.m SGT.

iTicketmaster has had a rough year with its ticketing service. It started in
iNovember, when a ticketing debacle around Taylor Swift's "The Eras Tour"
iresulted in everyone from longtime Swift stans to New York Rep. Alexandria
iOcasio-Cortez calling the site out for its botched processes.
i
iThe company blamed the long wait times and site glitches for Swift's show on
ia "staggering number of bot attacks as well as fans who didn't have codes."
i
iIt didn't stop there. In March, the Ticketmaster website crashed and
idisrupted ticket sales for the Eurovision Song Contest 2023, leaving some
iirate fans high and dry. Then the platform annoyed the BTS Army in March,
iwhen
iit canceled the rest of the sales for BTS rapper Suga's concert tour dates,
iciting "extremely high demand."
i
iColdplay and Ticketmaster Singapore did not immediately respond to requests
ifor comment from Insider.
