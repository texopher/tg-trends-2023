i===== Contents =====
i
iVladimir Vladimirovich Putin[c] (born 7 October 1952) is a Russian politician
iand former intelligence officer, serving as the current president of Russia.
iPutin has served continuously as president or prime minister since 1999:[d]
ias
iprime minister from 1999 to 2000 and from 2008 to 2012, and as president from
i2000 to 2008 and since 2012.[e][7]
i
iPutin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to
ithe rank of lieutenant colonel before resigning in 1991 to begin a political
icareer in Saint Petersburg. He moved to Moscow in 1996 to join the
iadministration of president Boris Yeltsin. He briefly served as director of
ithe Federal Security Service (FSB) and secretary of the Security Council of
iRussia, before being appointed prime minister in August 1999. After the
iresignation of Yeltsin, Putin became acting president and, less than four
imonths later, was elected outright to his first term as president. He was
ireelected in 2004. Because he was constitutionally limited to two consecutive
iterms as president, Putin served as prime minister again from 2008 to 2012
iunder Dmitry Medvedev. He returned to the presidency in 2012, in an election
imarred by allegations of fraud and protests, and was reelected in 2018. In
iApril 2021, after a referendum, he signed into law constitutional amendments
iincluding one that would allow him to run for reelection twice more,
ipotentially extending his presidency to 2036.[8][9]
i
iDuring Putin's first tenure as president, the Russian economy grew on average
iby seven percent per year,[10] after economic reforms and a fivefold increase
iin the price of oil and gas.[11][12] Putin also led Russia during a war
iagainst Chechen separatists, reestablishing federal control of the
iregion.[13][14] As prime minister under Medvedev, he oversaw a war against
iGeorgia and military and police reform. During his third term as president,
iRussia annexed Crimea and sponsored a war in eastern Ukraine with several
imilitary incursions made, resulting in international sanctions and a
ifinancial
icrisis in Russia. He also ordered a military intervention in Syria to support
iRussian ally Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war, eventually securing a
ideal that granted permanent naval bases in the Eastern Mediterranean.[f]
iDuring his fourth term as president, he launched a large invasion of Ukraine
iin February 2022, provoking international condemnation and significantly
iexpanded sanctions. In September 2022, he announced a partial mobilisation
iand
iforcibly annexed four Ukrainian oblasts into Russia. In March 2023, the
iInternational Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war
icrimes[18] in connection to his alleged criminal responsibility for illegal
ichild abductions during the war.[19]
i
iUnder Putin's leadership, Russia has undergone democratic backsliding and a
ishift to authoritarianism. His rule has been characterised by endemic
icorruption and widespread human rights violations, including the imprisonment
iand repression of political opponents, the intimidation and suppression of
iindependent media in Russia, and a lack of free and fair
ielections.[20][21][22] Putin's Russia has scored poorly on Transparency
iInternational's Corruption Perceptions Index, the Economist Intelligence
iUnit's Democracy Index, Freedom House's Freedom in the World index, and the
iReporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index. Putin is the longest-serving
iRussian president and the second-longest currently serving European
ipresident,
iafter Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus.
i
i===== Early life =====
i
iPutin was born on 7 October 1952 in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint
iPetersburg, Russia),[23][24] the youngest of three children of Vladimir
iSpiridonovich Putin (1911–1999) and Maria Ivanovna Putina (née Shelomova;
i1911–1998). His grandfather, Spiridon Putin (1879–1965), was a personal cook
ito Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.[25][26] Putin's birth was preceded by
ithe
ideaths of two brothers: Albert, born in the 1930s, died in infancy, and
iViktor, born in 1940, died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 during the
iSiege of Leningrad by Nazi Germany's forces in World War II.[27][28]
i
iPutin's mother was a factory worker and his father was a conscript in the
iSoviet Navy, serving in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s. During the
iearly stage of Nazi German invasion of Soviet Union, his father served in the
idestruction battalion of the NKVD.[29][30][31] Later, he was transferred to
ithe regular army and was severely wounded in 1942.[32] Putin's maternal
igrandmother was killed by the German occupiers of Tver region in 1941, and
ihis
imaternal uncles disappeared on the Eastern Front during World War II.[33]
i
i===== Education =====
i
iOn 1 September 1960, Putin started at School No. 193 at Baskov Lane, near his
ihome. He was one of a few in his class of about 45 pupils who were not yet
imembers of the Young Pioneer organization. At age 12, he began to practise
isambo and judo.[34] In his free time, he enjoyed reading the works of Karl
iMarx, Friedrich Engels, and Lenin.[35] Putin studied German at Saint
iPetersburg High School 281 and speaks German as a second language.[36]
i
iPutin studied law at the Leningrad State University named after Andrei
iZhdanov (now Saint Petersburg State University) in 1970 and graduated in
i1975.[37] His thesis was on "The Most Favored Nation Trading Principle in
iInternational Law".[38] While there, he was required to join the Communist
iParty of the Soviet Union (CPSU); he would remain a member until it ceased to
iexist in 1991.[39]
i
iPutin met Anatoly Sobchak, an assistant professor who taught business law,[g]
iand who later became the co-author of the Russian constitution and of
icorruption schemes in France. Putin would be influential in Sobchak's career
iin Saint Petersburg, and Sobchak would be influential in Putin's career in
iMoscow.[40]
i
iIn 1997, he received his Ph.D. in economics (Candidate of Economic Sciences)
iat the Saint Petersburg Mining University for a thesis on the strategic
iplanning of the mineral economy.[41]
i
i===== KGB career =====
i
iIn 1975, Putin joined the KGB and trained at the 401st KGB School in Okhta,
iLeningrad.[23][42] After training, he worked in the Second Chief Directorate
i(counterintelligence), before he was transferred to the First Chief
iDirectorate, where he monitored foreigners and consular officials in
iLeningrad.[23][43][44] In September 1984, Putin was sent to Moscow for
ifurther
itraining at the Yuri Andropov Red Banner Institute.[45][46][47]
i
iMultiple reports have suggested Putin was sent by the KGB to New Zealand,
icorroborated through New Zealand eyewitness accounts and government records.
iThis has never been confirmed by Russian security services. Former Waitākere
iCity mayor Bob Harvey and former Prime Minister David Lange alleged that
iPutin
iserved in Wellington and Auckland.[48] He allegedly worked for some time
iundercover as a Bata shoe salesman in central Wellington.[48][49][50]
i
iFrom 1985 to 1990, he served in Dresden, East Germany,[51] using a cover
iidentity as a translator.[52] While posted in Dresden, Putin worked as one of
iKGB's liaison officers to the Stasi secret police and reportedly got promoted
ias lieutenant colonel. According to official Kremlin Presidential site, the
iEast German communist regime commended Putin with a bronze medal for
i"faithful
iservice to the National People's Army". Putin has publicly conveyed delight
iover his activities in Dresden, once recounting his confrontations with
ianti-communist protestors of 1989 who attempted the occupation of Stasi
ibuildings in the city.[53]
i
i"Putin and his colleagues were reduced mainly to collecting press clippings,
ithus contributing to the mountains of useless information produced by the
iKGB", Russian-American Masha Gessen wrote in their 2012 biography of
iPutin.[52] His work was also downplayed by former Stasi spy chief Markus Wolf
iand Putin's former KGB colleague Vladimir Usoltsev. Journalist Catherine
iBelton wrote in 2020 that this downplaying was actually cover for Putin's
iinvolvement in KGB coordination and support for the terrorist Red Army
iFaction, whose members frequently hid in East Germany with the support of the
iStasi. Dresden was preferred as a "marginal" town with only a small presence
iof Western intelligence services.[54] According to an anonymous source who
iclaimed to be a former RAF member, at one of these meetings in Dresden the
imilitants presented Putin with a list of weapons that were later delivered to
ithe RAF in West Germany. Klaus Zuchold, who claimed to be recruited by Putin,
isaid that Putin handled a neo-Nazi, Rainer Sonntag, and attempted to recruit
ian author of a study on poisons.[54] Putin reportedly met Germans to be
irecruited for wireless communications affairs together with an interpreter.
iHe
iwas involved in wireless communications technologies in South-East Asia due
ito
itrips of German engineers, recruited by him, there and to the West.[44]
iHowever, a 2023 investigation by Der Spiegel reported that the anonymous
isource had never been an RAF member and "considered a notorious fabulist"
iwith
i"several previous convictions, including for making false statements."[55]
i
iAccording to Putin's official biography, during the fall of the Berlin Wall
ithat began on 9 November 1989, he saved the files of the Soviet Cultural
iCenter (House of Friendship) and of the KGB villa in Dresden for the official
iauthorities of the would-be united Germany to prevent demonstrators,
iincluding
iKGB and Stasi agents, from obtaining and destroying them. He then supposedly
iburnt only the KGB files, in a few hours, but saved the archives of the
iSoviet
iCultural Center for the German authorities. Nothing is told about the
iselection criteria during this burning; for example, concerning Stasi files
ior
iabout files of other agencies of the German Democratic Republic or of the
iUSSR. He explained that many documents were left to Germany only because the
ifurnace burst but many documents of the KGB villa were sent to Moscow.[57]
i
iAfter the collapse of the Communist East German government, Putin was to
iresign from active KGB service because of suspicions aroused regarding his
iloyalty during demonstrations in Dresden and earlier, though the KGB and the
iSoviet Army still operated in eastern Germany. He returned to Leningrad in
iearly 1990 as a member of the "active reserves", where he worked for about
ithree months with the International Affairs section of Leningrad State
iUniversity, reporting to Vice-Rector Yuriy Molchanov, while working on his
idoctoral dissertation.[44]
i
iThere, he looked for new KGB recruits, watched the student body, and renewed
ihis friendship with his former professor, Anatoly Sobchak, soon to be the
iMayor of Leningrad.[58] Putin claims that he resigned with the rank of
ilieutenant colonel on 20 August 1991,[58] on the second day of the 1991
iSoviet
icoup d'état attempt against the Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.[59] Putin
isaid: "As soon as the coup began, I immediately decided which side I was on",
ialthough he noted that the choice was hard because he had spent the best part
iof his life with "the organs".[60]
i
i===== Political career =====
i
iIn May 1990, Putin was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to
ithe mayor of Leningrad Anatoly Sobchak. In a 2017 interview with Oliver
iStone,
iPutin said that he resigned from the KGB in 1991, following the coup against
iMikhail Gorbachev, as he did not agree with what had happened and did not
iwant
ito be part of the intelligence in the new administration.[61] According to
iPutin's statements in 2018 and 2021, he may have worked as a private taxi
idriver to earn extra money, or considered such a job.[62][63]
i
iOn 28 June 1991, he became head of the Committee for External Relations of
ithe Mayor's Office, with responsibility for promoting international relations
iand foreign investments[65] and registering business ventures. Within a year,
iPutin was investigated by the city legislative council led by Marina Salye.
iIt
iwas concluded that he had understated prices and permitted the export of
imetals valued at $93 million in exchange for foreign food aid that never
iarrived.[66][37] Despite the investigators' recommendation that Putin be
ifired, Putin remained head of the Committee for External Relations until
i1996.[67][68] From 1994 to 1996, he held several other political and
igovernmental positions in Saint Petersburg.[69]
i
iIn March 1994, Putin was appointed as first deputy chairman of the Government
iof Saint Petersburg. In May 1995, he organized the Saint Petersburg branch of
ithe pro-government Our Home – Russia political party, the liberal party of
ipower founded by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. In 1995, he managed the
ilegislative election campaign for that party, and from 1995 through June
i1997,
ihe was the leader of its Saint Petersburg branch.[69]
i
iIn June 1996, Sobchak lost his bid for re-election in Saint Petersburg, and
iPutin, who had led his election campaign, resigned from his positions in the
icity administration. He moved to Moscow and was appointed as deputy chief of
ithe Presidential Property Management Department headed by Pavel Borodin. He
ioccupied this position until March 1997. He was responsible for the foreign
iproperty of the state and organized the transfer of the former assets of the
iSoviet Union and the CPSU to the Russian Federation.[40]
i
iOn 26 March 1997, President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin deputy chief of the
iPresidential Staff, a post which he retained until May 1998, and chief of the
iMain Control Directorate of the Presidential Property Management Department
i(until June 1998). His predecessor in this position was Alexei Kudrin and his
isuccessor was Nikolai Patrushev, both future prominent politicians and
iPutin's
iassociates.[40] On 3 April 1997, Putin was promoted to 1st class Active State
iCouncillor of the Russian Federation — the highest federal state civilian
iservice rank.[70]
i
iOn 27 June 1997, at the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute, guided by rector
iVladimir Litvinenko, Putin defended his Candidate of Science dissertation in
ieconomics, titled Strategic Planning of the Reproduction of the Mineral
iResource Base of a Region under Conditions of the Formation of Market
iRelations.[71] This exemplified the custom in Russia whereby a young rising
iofficial would write a scholarly work in mid-career.[72] Putin's thesis was
iplagiarized.[73] Fellows at the Brookings Institution found that 15 pages
iwere
icopied from an American textbook.[74][75]
i
iOn 25 May 1998, Putin was appointed First Deputy Chief of the Presidential
iStaff for the regions, in succession to Viktoriya Mitina. On 15 July, he was
iappointed head of the commission for the preparation of agreements on the
idelimitation of the power of the regions and head of the federal center
iattached to the president, replacing Sergey Shakhray. After Putin's
iappointment, the commission completed no such agreements, although during
iShakhray's term as the head of the Commission 46 such agreements had been
isigned.[76] Later, after becoming president, Putin cancelled all 46
iagreements.[40]
i
iOn 25 July 1998, Yeltsin appointed Putin director of the Federal Security
iService (FSB), the primary intelligence and security organization of the
iRussian Federation and the successor to the KGB.[77]
i
iIn 1999, Putin described communism as "a blind alley, far away from the
imainstream of civilization".[78]
i
iOn 9 August 1999, Putin was appointed one of three first deputy prime
iministers, and later on that day, was appointed acting prime minister of the
iGovernment of the Russian Federation by President Yeltsin.[79] Yeltsin also
iannounced that he wanted to see Putin as his successor. Later on that same
iday, Putin agreed to run for the presidency.[80]
i
iOn 16 August, the State Duma approved his appointment as prime minister with
i233 votes in favor (vs. 84 against, 17 abstained),[81] while a simple
imajority
iof 226 was required, making him Russia's fifth prime minister in fewer than
ieighteen months. On his appointment, few expected Putin, virtually unknown to
ithe general public, to last any longer than his predecessors. He was
iinitially
iregarded as a Yeltsin loyalist; like other prime ministers of Boris Yeltsin,
iPutin did not choose ministers himself, his cabinet was determined by the
ipresidential administration.[82]
i
iYeltsin's main opponents and would-be successors were already campaigning to
ireplace the ailing president, and they fought hard to prevent Putin's
iemergence as a potential successor. Following the September 1999 Russian
iapartment bombings and the invasion of Dagestan by mujahideen, including the
iformer KGB agents, based in the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Putin's
ilaw-and-order image and unrelenting approach to the Second Chechen War soon
icombined to raise his popularity and allowed him to overtake his rivals.
i
iWhile not formally associated with any party, Putin pledged his support to
ithe newly formed Unity Party,[83] which won the second largest percentage of
ithe popular vote (23.3%) in the December 1999 Duma elections, and in turn
isupported Putin.
i
iOn 31 December 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned and, according to the
iConstitution of Russia, Putin became Acting President of the Russian
iFederation. On assuming this role, Putin went on a previously scheduled visit
ito Russian troops in Chechnya.[84]
i
iThe first presidential decree that Putin signed on 31 December 1999 was
ititled "On guarantees for the former president of the Russian Federation and
ithe members of his family".[85][86] This ensured that "corruption charges
iagainst the outgoing President and his relatives" would not be pursued.[87]
iThis was most notably targeted at the Mabetex bribery case in which Yeltsin's
ifamily members were involved. On 30 August 2000, a criminal investigation
i(number 18/238278-95) in which Putin himself,[88][89] as a member of the
iSaint
iPetersburg city government, was one of the suspects, was dropped.
i
iOn 30 December 2000, yet another case against the prosecutor general was
idropped "for lack of evidence", despite thousands of documents having been
iforwarded by Swiss prosecutors.[90] On 12 February 2001, Putin signed a
isimilar federal law which replaced the decree of 1999. A case regarding
iPutin's alleged corruption in metal exports from 1992 was brought back by
iMarina Salye, but she was silenced and forced to leave Saint Petersburg.[91]
i
iWhile his opponents had been preparing for an election in June 2000,
iYeltsin's resignation resulted in the presidential elections being held on 26
iMarch 2000; Putin won in the first round with 53% of the vote.[92][93]
i
iThe inauguration of President Putin occurred on 7 May 2000. He appointed the
iminister of finance, Mikhail Kasyanov, as prime minister.[94] The first major
ichallenge to Putin's popularity came in August 2000, when he was criticized
ifor the alleged mishandling of the Kursk submarine disaster.[95] That
icriticism was largely because it took several days for Putin to return from
ivacation, and several more before he visited the scene.[95]
i
iBetween 2000 and 2004, Putin set about the reconstruction of the impoverished
icondition of the country, apparently winning a power-struggle with the
iRussian
ioligarchs, reaching a 'grand bargain' with them. This bargain allowed the
ioligarchs to maintain most of their powers, in exchange for their explicit
isupport for—and alignment with—Putin's government.[96][97]
i
iThe Moscow theater hostage crisis occurred in October 2002. Many in the
iRussian press and in the international media warned that the deaths of 130
ihostages in the special forces' rescue operation during the crisis would
iseverely damage President Putin's popularity. However, shortly after the
isiege
ihad ended, the Russian president enjoyed record public approval ratings—83%
iof
iRussians declared themselves satisfied with Putin and his handling of the
isiege.[98]
i
iIn 2003, a referendum was held in Chechnya, adopting a new constitution which
ideclares that the Republic of Chechnya is a part of Russia; on the other
ihand,
ithe region did acquire autonomy.[99] Chechnya has been gradually stabilized
iwith the establishment of the Parliamentary elections and a Regional
iGovernment.[100][101] Throughout the Second Chechen War, Russia severely
idisabled the Chechen rebel movement; however, sporadic attacks by rebels
icontinued to occur throughout the northern Caucasus.[102]
i
iOn 14 March 2004, Putin was elected to the presidency for a second term,
ireceiving 71% of the vote.[104] The Beslan school hostage crisis took place
ion
i1–3 September 2004; more than 330 people died, including 186 children.[105]
i
iThe near 10-year period prior to the rise of Putin after the dissolution of
iSoviet rule was a time of upheaval in Russia.[106] In a 2005 Kremlin speech,
iPutin characterized the collapse of the Soviet Union as the "greatest
igeopolitical catastrophe of the Twentieth Century."[107] Putin elaborated,
i"Moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected Russia itself."[108] The
icountry's cradle-to-grave social safety net was gone and life expectancy
ideclined in the period preceding Putin's rule.[109] In 2005, the National
iPriority Projects were launched to improve Russia's health care, education,
ihousing, and agriculture.[110][111]
i
iThe continued criminal prosecution of the wealthiest man in Russia at the
itime, president of Yukos oil and gas company Mikhail Khodorkovsky, for fraud
iand tax evasion was seen by the international press as a retaliation for
iKhodorkovsky's donations to both liberal and communist opponents of the
iKremlin.[112] Khodorkovsky was arrested, Yukos was bankrupted, and the
icompany's assets were auctioned at below-market value, with the largest share
iacquired by the state company Rosneft.[113] The fate of Yukos was seen as a
isign of a broader shift of Russia towards a system of state
icapitalism.[114][115] This was underscored in July 2014, when shareholders of
iYukos were awarded $50 billion in compensation by the Permanent Arbitration
iCourt in The Hague.[116]
i
iOn 7 October 2006, Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist who exposed corruption in
ithe Russian army and its conduct in Chechnya, was shot in the lobby of her
iapartment building, on Putin's birthday. The death of Politkovskaya triggered
iinternational criticism, with accusations that Putin had failed to protect
ithe
icountry's new independent media.[117][118] Putin himself said that her death
icaused the government more problems than her writings.[119]
i
iIn a January 2007 meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at his Black
iSea residence in Sochi, two weeks after Russia switched off oil supplies to
iGermany, Putin brought his black Labrador Konni in front of Merkel, who has a
inoted phobia of dogs and looked visibly uncomfortable in its presence, adding
i"I'm sure it will behave itself"; causing a furor among the German press
icorps.[120][121] Being asked about the incident in a January 2016 interview
iwith Bild, Putin claimed he was not aware of her phobia, adding "I wanted to
imake her happy. When I found out that she did not like dogs, I of course
iapologized."[122] Merkel later told a group of reporters:
i
iIn February 2007, at the Munich Security Conference Putin complained about
ithe feeling of insecurity engendered by the dominant position in geopolitics
iof the United States, and observed that a former NATO official had made
irhetorical promises not to expand into new countries in Eastern Europe.
i
iOn 14 July 2007, Putin announced that Russia would suspend implementation of
iits Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe obligations, effective
iafter
i150 days,[123][124] and suspend its ratification of the Adapted Conventional
iArmed Forces in Europe Treaty which treaty was shunned by NATO members
iabeyant
iRussian withdrawal from Transnistria and the Republic of Georgia. Moscow
icontinued to participate in the joint consultative group, because it hoped
ithat dialogue could lead to the creation of an effective, new conventional
iarms control regime in Europe.[125] Russia did specify steps that NATO could
itake to end the suspension. "These include [NATO] members cutting their arms
iallotments and further restricting temporary weapons deployments on each NATO
imember's territory. Russia also want[ed] constraints eliminated on how many
iforces it can deploy in its southern and northern flanks. Moreover, it is
ipressing NATO members to ratify a 1999 updated version of the accord, known
ias
ithe Adapted CFE Treaty, and demanding that the four alliance members outside
ithe original treaty, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovenia, join it."[124]
i
iIn early 2007, "Dissenters' Marches" were organized by the opposition group
iThe Other Russia,[126] led by former chess champion Garry Kasparov and
inational-Bolshevist leader Eduard Limonov. Following prior warnings,
idemonstrations in several Russian cities were met by police action, which
iincluded interfering with the travel of the protesters and the arrests of as
imany as 150 people who attempted to break through police lines.[127]
i
iOn 12 September 2007, Putin dissolved the government upon the request of
iPrime Minister Mikhail Fradkov. Fradkov commented that it was to give the
iPresident a "free hand" in the run-up to the parliamentary election. Viktor
iZubkov was appointed the new prime minister.[128]
i
iIn December 2007, United Russia—the governing party that supports the
ipolicies of Putin—won 64.24% of the popular vote in their run for State Duma
iaccording to election preliminary results.[129] United Russia's victory in
ithe
iDecember 2007 elections was seen by many as an indication of strong popular
isupport of the then Russian leadership and its policies.[130][131]
i
iPutin was barred from a third consecutive term by the Constitution. First
iDeputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was elected his successor. In a
ipower-switching operation on 8 May 2008, only a day after handing the
ipresidency to Medvedev, Putin was appointed Prime Minister of Russia,
imaintaining his political dominance.[132]
i
iPutin has said that overcoming the consequences of the world economic crisis
iwas one of the two main achievements of his second premiership.[111] The
iother
iwas stabilizing the size of Russia's population between 2008 and 2011
ifollowing a long period of demographic collapse that began in the 1990s.[111]
i
iAt the United Russia Congress in Moscow on 24 September 2011, Medvedev
iofficially proposed that Putin stand for the presidency in 2012, an offer
iPutin accepted. Given United Russia's near-total dominance of Russian
ipolitics, many observers believed that Putin was assured of a third term. The
imove was expected to see Medvedev stand on the United Russia ticket in the
iparliamentary elections in December, with a goal of becoming prime minister
iat
ithe end of his presidential term.[133]
i
iAfter the parliamentary elections on 4 December 2011, tens of thousands of
iRussians engaged in protests against alleged electoral fraud, the largest
iprotests in Putin's time. Protesters criticized Putin and United Russia and
idemanded annulment of the election results.[134] Those protests sparked the
ifear of a colour revolution in society.[135] Putin allegedly organized a
inumber of paramilitary groups loyal to himself and to the United Russia party
iin the period between 2005 and 2012.[136]
i
iOn 24 September 2011, while speaking at the United Russia party congress,
iMedvedev announced that he would recommend the party nominate Putin as its
ipresidential candidate. He also revealed that the two men had long ago cut a
ideal to allow Putin to run for president in 2012.[137] This switch was termed
iby many in the media as "Rokirovka", the Russian term for the chess move
i"castling".[138]
i
iOn 4 March 2012, Putin won the 2012 Russian presidential election in the
ifirst round, with 63.6% of the vote, despite widespread accusations of
ivote-rigging.[139][140][141] Opposition groups accused Putin and the United
iRussia party of fraud.[142] While efforts to make the elections transparent
iwere publicized, including the usage of webcams in polling stations, the vote
iwas criticized by the Russian opposition and by international observers from
ithe Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe for procedural
iirregularities.[143]
i
iAnti-Putin protests took place during and directly after the presidential
icampaign. The most notorious protest was the Pussy Riot performance on 21
iFebruary, and subsequent trial.[144] An estimated 8,000–20,000 protesters
igathered in Moscow on 6 May,[145][146] when eighty people were injured in
iconfrontations with police,[147] and 450 were arrested, with another 120
iarrests taking place the following day.[148] A counter-protest of Putin
isupporters occurred which culminated in a gathering of an estimated 130,000
isupporters at the Luzhniki Stadium, Russia's largest stadium.[149] Some of
ithe
iattendees stated that they had been paid to come, were forced to come by
itheir
iemployers, or were misled into believing that they were going to attend a
ifolk
ifestival instead.[150][151][152] The rally is considered to be the largest in
isupport of Putin to date.[153]
i
iPutin's presidency was inaugurated in the Kremlin on 7 May 2012.[154] On his
ifirst day as president, Putin issued 14 presidential decrees, which are
isometimes called the "May Decrees" by the media, including a lengthy one
istating wide-ranging goals for the Russian economy. Other decrees concerned
ieducation, housing, skilled labor training, relations with the European
iUnion,
ithe defense industry, inter-ethnic relations, and other policy areas dealt
iwith in Putin's program articles issued during the presidential
icampaign.[155]
i
iIn 2012 and 2013, Putin and the United Russia party backed stricter
ilegislation against the LGBT community, in Saint Petersburg, Archangelsk, and
iNovosibirsk; a law called the Russian gay propaganda law, that is against
i"homosexual propaganda" (which prohibits such symbols as the rainbow
iflag,[156][157] as well as published works containing homosexual content) was
iadopted by the State Duma in June 2013.[158][159] Responding to international
iconcerns about Russia's legislation, Putin asked critics to note that the law
iwas a "ban on the propaganda of pedophilia and homosexuality" and he stated
ithat homosexual visitors to the 2014 Winter Olympics should "leave the
ichildren in peace" but denied there was any "professional, career or social
idiscrimination" against homosexuals in Russia.[160]
i
iIn June 2013, Putin attended a televised rally of the All-Russia People's
iFront where he was elected head of the movement,[161] which was set up in
i2011.[162] According to journalist Steve Rosenberg, the movement is intended
ito "reconnect the Kremlin to the Russian people" and one day, if necessary,
ireplace the increasingly unpopular United Russia party that currently backs
iPutin.[163]
i
iIn February 2014, Russia made several military incursions into Ukrainian
iterritory. After the Euromaidan protests and the fall of Ukrainian president
iViktor Yanukovych, Russian soldiers without insignias took control of
istrategic positions and infrastructure within the Ukrainian territory of
iCrimea. Russia then annexed Crimea and Sevastopol after a referendum in
iwhich,
iaccording to official results, Crimeans voted to join the Russian
iFederation.[164][165][166] Subsequently, demonstrations against Ukrainian
iRada
ilegislative actions by pro-Russian groups in the Donbas area of Ukraine
iescalated into the Russo-Ukrainian War between the Ukrainian government and
ithe Russia-backed separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk
iPeople's Republics. In August 2014,[167] Russian military vehicles crossed
ithe
iborder in several locations of Donetsk Oblast.[168][169][170] The incursion
iby
ithe Russian military was seen by Ukrainian authorities as responsible for the
idefeat of Ukrainian forces in early September.[171][172]
i
iIn October 2014, Putin addressed Russian security concerns in Sochi at the
iValdai International Discussion Club.
i
iIn November 2014, the Ukrainian military reported intensive movement of
itroops and equipment from Russia into the separatist-controlled parts of
ieastern Ukraine.[173] The Associated Press reported 80 unmarked military
ivehicles on the move in rebel-controlled areas.[174] An OSCE Special
iMonitoring Mission observed convoys of heavy weapons and tanks in
iDPR-controlled territory without insignia.[175] OSCE monitors further stated
ithat they observed vehicles transporting ammunition and soldiers' dead bodies
icrossing the Russian-Ukrainian border under the guise of humanitarian-aid
iconvoys.[176]
i
iAs of early August 2015, the OSCE observed over 21 such vehicles marked with
ithe Russian military code for soldiers killed in action.[177] According to
iThe
iMoscow Times, Russia has tried to intimidate and silence human-rights workers
idiscussing Russian soldiers' deaths in the conflict.[178] The OSCE repeatedly
ireported that its observers were denied access to the areas controlled by
i"combined Russian-separatist forces".[179]
i
iIn October 2015, The Washington Post reported that Russia had redeployed some
iof its elite units from Ukraine to Syria in recent weeks to support Syrian
iPresident Bashar al-Assad.[180] In December 2015, Putin admitted that Russian
imilitary intelligence officers were operating in Ukraine.[181]
i
iThe Moscow Times quoted pro-Russian academic Andrei Tsygankov as saying that
imany members of the international community assumed that Putin's annexation
iof
iCrimea had initiated a completely new kind of Russian foreign
ipolicy[182][183]
iand that his foreign policy had shifted "from state-driven foreign policy" to
itaking an offensive stance to recreate the Soviet Union. In July 2015, he
iopined that this policy shift could be understood as Putin trying to defend
inations in Russia's sphere of influence from "encroaching western
ipower".[184]
i
iOn 30 September 2015, President Putin authorized Russian military
iintervention in the Syrian civil war, following a formal request by the
iSyrian
igovernment for military help against rebel and jihadist groups.[185]
i
iThe Russian military activities consisted of air strikes, cruise missile
istrikes and the use of front line advisors and Russian special forces against
imilitant groups opposed to the Syrian government, including the Syrian
iopposition, as well as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), al-Nusra
iFront (al-Qaeda in the Levant), Tahrir al-Sham, Ahrar al-Sham, and the Army
iof
iConquest.[186][187] After Putin's announcement on 14 March 2016 that the
imission he had set for the Russian military in Syria had been "largely
iaccomplished" and ordered the withdrawal of the "main part" of the Russian
iforces from Syria,[188] Russian forces deployed in Syria continued to
iactively
ioperate in support of the Syrian government.[189]
i
iIn January 2017, a U.S. intelligence community assessment expressed high
iconfidence that Putin personally ordered an influence campaign, initially to
idenigrate Hillary Clinton and to harm her electoral chances and potential
ipresidency, then later developing "a clear preference" for Donald Trump.[190]
iTrump consistently denied any Russian interference in the U.S.
ielection,[191][192][193] as did Putin in December 2016,[194] March 2017,[195]
iJune 2017,[196][197][198] and July 2017.[199]
i
iPutin later stated that interference was "theoretically possible" and could
ihave been perpetrated by "patriotically minded" Russian hackers,[200] and on
ianother occasion claimed "not even Russians, but Ukrainians, Tatars or Jews,
ibut with Russian citizenship" might have been responsible.[201] In July 2018,
iThe New York Times reported that the CIA had long nurtured a Russian source
iwho eventually rose to a position close to Putin, allowing the source to pass
ikey information in 2016 about Putin's direct involvement.[202] Putin
icontinued
isimilar attempts in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[203]
i
iPutin won the 2018 Russian presidential election with more than 76% of the
ivote.[204] His fourth term began on 7 May 2018,[205] and will last until
i2024.[206] On the same day, Putin invited Dmitry Medvedev to form a new
igovernment.[207] On 15 May 2018, Putin took part in the opening of the
imovement along the highway section of the Crimean bridge.[208] On 18 May
i2018,
iPutin signed decrees on the composition of the new Government.[209] On 25 May
i2018, Putin announced that he would not run for president in 2024, justifying
ithis in compliance with the Russian Constitution.[210] On 14 June 2018, Putin
iopened the 21st FIFA World Cup, which took place in Russia for the first
itime.
iOn 18 October 2018, Putin said Russians will 'go to Heaven as martyrs' in the
ievent of a nuclear war as he would only use nuclear weapons in
iretaliation.[211] In September 2019, Putin's administration interfered with
ithe results of Russia's nationwide regional elections and manipulated it by
ieliminating all candidates in the opposition. The event that was aimed at
icontributing to the ruling party, United Russia's victory, also contributed
ito
iinciting mass protests for democracy, leading to large-scale arrests and
icases
iof police brutality.[212]
i
iOn 15 January 2020, Medvedev and his entire government resigned after Putin's
i2020 Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly. Putin suggested major
iconstitutional amendments that could extend his political power after
ipresidency.[213][214] At the same time, on behalf of Putin, he continued to
iexercise his powers until the formation of a new government.[215] Putin
isuggested that Medvedev take the newly created post of deputy chairman of the
iSecurity Council.[216]
i
iOn the same day, Putin nominated Mikhail Mishustin, head of the country's
iFederal Tax Service for the post of prime minister. The next day, he was
iconfirmed by the State Duma to the post,[217][218] and appointed prime
iminister by Putin's decree.[219] This was the first time ever that a prime
iminister was confirmed without any votes against. On 21 January 2020,
iMishustin presented to Putin a draft structure of his Cabinet. On the same
iday, the president signed a decree on the structure of the Cabinet and
iappointed the proposed ministers.[220][221][222]
i
iOn 15 March 2020, Putin instructed to form a Working Group of the State
iCouncil to counteract the spread of coronavirus. Putin appointed Moscow Mayor
iSergey Sobyanin as the head of the group.[223]
i
iOn 22 March 2020, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe
iConte, Putin arranged the Russian army to send military medics, special
idisinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy, which was the
iEuropean country hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.[224] Putin began
iworking remotely from his office at Novo-Ogaryovo. According to Dmitry
iPeskov,
iPutin passes daily tests for coronavirus, and his health is not in
idanger.[225][226]
i
iOn 25 March, President Putin announced in a televised address to the nation
ithat the 22 April constitutional referendum would be postponed due to the
icoronavirus.[227] He added that the next week would be a nationwide paid
iholiday and urged Russians to stay at home.[228][229] Putin also announced a
ilist of measures of social protection, support for small and medium-sized
ienterprises, and changes in fiscal policy.[230] Putin announced the following
imeasures for microenterprises, small- and medium-sized businesses: deferring
itax payments (except Russia's value-added tax) for the next six months,
icutting the size of social security contributions in half, deferring social
isecurity contributions, deferring loan repayments for the next six months, a
isix-month moratorium on fines, debt collection, and creditors' applications
ifor bankruptcy of debtor enterprises.[231][232]
i
iOn 2 April 2020, Putin again issued an address in which he announced
iprolongation of the non-working time until 30 April.[233] Putin likened
iRussia's fight against COVID-19 to Russia's battles with invading Pecheneg
iand
iCuman steppe nomads in the 10th and 11th centuries.[234] In a 24 to 27 April
iLevada poll, 48% of Russian respondents said that they disapproved of Putin's
ihandling of the coronavirus pandemic,[235] and his strict isolation and lack
iof leadership during the crisis was widely commented as sign of losing his
i"strongman" image.[236][237]
i
iIn June 2021, Putin said he was fully vaccinated against the disease with the
iSputnik V vaccine, emphasising that while vaccinations should be voluntary,
imaking them mandatory in some professions would slow down the spread of
iCOVID-19.[239] In September, Putin entered self-isolation after people in his
iinner circle tested positive for the disease.[240]
i
iAccording to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Putin's inner circle of
iadvisors shrank during the COVID-19 lockdown to a small number of hawkish
iadvisers.[241]
i
iPutin signed an executive order on 3 July 2020 to officially insert
iamendments into the Russian Constitution, allowing him to run for two
iadditional six-year terms. These amendments took effect on 4 July 2020.[242]
i
iSince 11 July, protests have been held in the Khabarovsk Krai in Russia's Far
iEast in support of arrested regional governor Sergei Furgal.[243] The 2020
iKhabarovsk Krai protests have become increasingly anti-Putin.[244][245] A
iJuly
i2020 Levada poll found that 45% of surveyed Russians supported the
iprotests.[246]
i
iOn 22 December 2020, Putin signed a bill giving lifetime prosecutorial
iimmunity to Russian ex-presidents.[247][248]
i
iPutin met Iran President Ebrahim Raisi in January 2022 to lay the groundwork
ifor a 20-year deal between the two nations.[249]
i
iIn July 2021, Putin published an essay titled On the Historical Unity of
iRussians and Ukrainians, in which he states that Belarusians, Ukrainians and
iRussians should be in one All-Russian nation as a part of the Russian world
iand are "one people" whom "forces that have always sought to undermine our
iunity" wanted to "divide and rule".[250] The essay denies the existence of
iUkraine as an independent nation.[251][252]
i
iOn 30 November 2021, Putin stated that an enlargement of NATO in Ukraine
iwould be a "red line" issue for Russia.[253][254][255] The Kremlin repeatedly
idenied that it had any plans to invade Ukraine,[256][257][258] and Putin
ihimself dismissed such fears as "alarmist".[259] On 21 February 2022, Putin
isigned a decree recognizing the two self proclaimed separatist republics in
iDonbas as independent states and made an address concerning the events in
iUkraine.[260]
i
iPutin was persuaded to invade Ukraine by a small group of his closest
iassociates, especially Nikolai Patrushev, Yury Kovalchuk and Alexander
iBortnikov.[261] According to sources close to the Kremlin, most of Putin's
iadvisers and associates opposed the invasion, but Putin overruled them. The
iinvasion of Ukraine had been planned for almost a year.[262]
i
iOn 24 February, Putin in a televised address announced a "special military
ioperation"[263] in Ukraine,[264][265] launching a full-scale invasion of the
icountry.[266] Citing a purpose of "denazification", he claimed to be doing
ithis to protect people in the predominantly Russian-speaking region of Donbas
iwho, according to Putin, faced "humiliation and genocide" from Ukraine for
ieight years.[267] Minutes after the speech, he launched a war to gain control
iof the remainder of the country and overthrow the elected government under
ithe
ipretext that it was run by Nazis.[268][269]
i
iRussia's invasion was met with international condemnation.[270][271][272]
iInternational sanctions were widely imposed against Russia, including against
iPutin personally.[273][274] The invasion also led to numerous calls for Putin
ito be pursued with war crime charges.[275][276][277][278] The International
iCriminal Court (ICC) stated that it would investigate the possibility of war
icrimes in Ukraine since late 2013,[279] and the United States pledged to help
ithe ICC to prosecute Putin and others for war crimes committed during the
iinvasion of Ukraine.[280] In response to these condemnations, Putin put the
iStrategic Rocket Forces's nuclear deterrence units on high alert.[281] By
iearly March, U.S. intelligence agencies determined that Putin was
i"frustrated"
iby slow progress due to an unexpectedly strong Ukrainian defense.[282]
i
iOn 4 March, Putin signed into law a bill introducing prison sentences of up
ito 15 years for those who publish "knowingly false information" about the
iRussian military and its operations, leading to some media outlets in Russia
ito stop reporting on Ukraine.[283] On 7 March, as a condition for ending the
iinvasion, the Kremlin demanded Ukraine's neutrality, recognition of Crimea as
iRussian territory, and recognition of the self-proclaimed republics of
iDonetsk
iand Luhansk as independent states.[284][285] On 16 March, Putin issued a
iwarning to Russian "traitors" who he said the West wanted to use as a "fifth
icolumn" to destroy Russia.[286][287]
i
iAs early as 25 March, the UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights
ireported that Putin ordered a "kidnapping" policy, whereby Ukrainian
inationals
iwho did not cooperate with the Russian takeover of their homeland were
ivictimized by FSB agents.[288][289] On 28 March, Ukrainian President
iVolodymyr
iZelenskyy said he was "99.9 percent sure" that Putin thought the Ukrainians
iwould welcome the invading forces with "flowers and smiles" while he opened
ithe door to negotiations on the offer that Ukraine would henceforth be a
inon-aligned state.[290]
i
iOn 21 September, Putin announced a partial mobilisation, following a
isuccessful Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv and the announcement of
iannexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine.[291]
i
iOn 30 September, Putin signed decrees which annexed Donetsk, Luhansk,
iZaporizhzhia and Kherson Oblasts of Ukraine into the Russian Federation. The
iannexations are not recognized by the international community, and are
iillegal
iunder international law.[292] On 11 November the same year, Ukraine liberated
iKherson.[293]
i
iIn December 2022, he said that a war against Ukraine could be a "long
iprocess".[294] Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the
iRusso-Ukrainian War since February 2022.[295][296] In January 2023, Putin
icited recognition of Russia's sovereignty over the annexed territories as a
icondition for peace talks with Ukraine.[297]
i
iOn 20–22 March 2023, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Russia and met with
iVladimir Putin both in official and unofficial capacity.[298] It was the
ifirst
iinternational meeting of Vladimir Putin since the International Criminal
iCourt
iissued a warrant for his arrest.[299]
i
iIn May 2023, South Africa announced that it would grant diplomatic immunity
ito Vladimir Putin to attend the 15th BRICS Summit in Johannesburg despite the
iICC arrest warrant.[300]
i
iOn 17 March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for
iPutin's arrest,[301][302][303][304] alleging that Putin held criminal
iresponsibility in the illegal deportation and transfer of children from
iUkraine to Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[305][306][307]
i
iIt was the first time that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for the head
iof state of one of the five Permanent Members of the United Nations Security
iCouncil,[301] (the world's five principal nuclear powers).[308]
i
iThe ICC simultaneously issued an arrest warrant for Maria Lvova-Belova,
iCommissioner for Children's Rights in the Office of the President of the
iRussian Federation. Both are charged with...
i
i...for their publicized program, since February 24, 2022, of forced
ideportations of thousands of unaccompanied Ukrainian children to Russia, from
iareas of eastern Ukraine under Russian control.[301][303] Russia has
imaintained that the deportations were humanitarian efforts to protect orphans
iand other children abandoned in the conflict region.[301]
i
i===== Domestic policies =====
i
iPutin's domestic policies, particularly early in his first presidency, were
iaimed at creating a vertical power structure. On 13 May 2000, he issued a
idecree organizing the 89 federal subjects of Russia into seven administrative
ifederal districts and appointed a presidential envoy responsible for each of
ithose districts (whose official title is Plenipotentiary
iRepresentative).[309]
i
iAccording to Stephen White, under the presidency of Putin, Russia made it
iclear that it had no intention of establishing a "second edition" of the
iAmerican or British political system, but rather a system that was closer to
iRussia's own traditions and circumstances.[310] Some commentators have
idescribed Putin's administration as a "sovereign democracy".[311][312][313]
iAccording to the proponents of that description (primarily Vladislav Surkov),
ithe government's actions and policies ought above all to enjoy popular
isupport
iwithin Russia itself and not be directed or influenced from outside the
icountry.[314]
i
iThe practice of the system is characterized by Swedish economist Anders
iÅslund as manual management, commenting: "After Putin resumed the presidency
iin 2012, his rule is best described as 'manual management' as the Russians
ilike to put it. Putin does whatever he wants, with little consideration to
ithe
iconsequences with one important caveat. During the Russian financial crash of
iAugust 1998, Putin learned that financial crises are politically
idestabilizing
iand must be avoided at all costs. Therefore, he cares about financial
istability."[315]
i
iThe period after 2012 saw mass protests against the falsification of
ielections, censorship and toughening of free assembly laws. In July 2000,
iaccording to a law proposed by Putin and approved by the Federal Assembly of
iRussia, Putin gained the right to dismiss the heads of the 89 federal
isubjects. In 2004, the direct election of those heads (usually called
i"governors") by popular vote was replaced with a system whereby they would be
inominated by the president and approved or disapproved by regional
ilegislatures.[316][317]
i
iThis was seen by Putin as a necessary move to stop separatist tendencies and
iget rid of those governors who were connected with organised crime.[318] This
iand other government actions effected under Putin's presidency have been
icriticized by many independent Russian media outlets and Western commentators
ias anti-democratic.[319][320] In 2012, as proposed by Putin's successor,
iDmitry Medvedev, the direct election of governors was re-introduced.[citation
ineeded]
i
iDuring his first term in office, Putin opposed some of the Yeltsin-era
ibusiness oligarchs, as well as his political opponents, resulting in the
iexile
ior imprisonment of such people as Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, and
iMikhail Khodorkovsky; other oligarchs such as Roman Abramovich and Arkady
iRotenberg are friends and allies with Putin.[321] Putin succeeded in
icodifying
iland law and tax law and promulgated new codes on labor, administrative,
icriminal, commercial and civil procedural law.[322] Under Medvedev's
ipresidency, Putin's government implemented some key reforms in the area of
istate security, the Russian police reform and the Russian military
ireform.[323]
i
iSergey Guriyev, when talking about Putin's economic policy, divided it into
ifour distinct periods: the "reform" years of his first term (1999–2003); the
i"statist" years of his second term (2004 – the first half of 2008); the world
ieconomic crisis and recovery (the second half of 2008–2013); and the
iRusso-Ukrainian War, Russia's growing isolation from the global economy, and
istagnation (2014–present).[324]
i
iIn 2000, Putin launched the "Programme for the Socio-Economic Development of
ithe Russian Federation for the Period 2000–2010", but it was abandoned in
i2008
iwhen it was 30% complete.[325] Fueled by the 2000s commodities boom including
irecord-high oil prices,[11][12] under the Putin administration from 2000 to
i2016, an increase in income in USD terms was 4.5 times.[326] During Putin's
ifirst eight years in office, industry grew substantially, as did production,
iconstruction, real incomes, credit, and the middle class.[327][328] A fund
ifor
ioil revenue allowed Russia to repay all of the Soviet Union's debts by
i2005.[citation needed] Russia joined the World Trade Organization on 22
iAugust
i2012.[329]
i
iIn 2006, Putin launched an industry consolidation programme to bring the main
iaircraft-producing companies under a single umbrella organization, the United
iAircraft Corporation (UAC).[330][331] In September 2020, the UAC general
idirector announced that the UAC will receive the largest-ever post-Soviet
igovernment support package for the aircraft industry in order to pay and
irenegotiate the debt.[332][333]
i
iIn 2014, Putin signed a deal to supply China with 38 billion cubic meters of
inatural gas per year. Power of Siberia, which Putin has called the "world's
ibiggest construction project", was launched in 2019 and is expected to
icontinue for 30 years at an ultimate cost to China of $400bn.[335] The
iongoing
ifinancial crisis began in the second half of 2014 when the Russian ruble
icollapsed due to a decline in the price of oil and international sanctions
iagainst Russia. These events in turn led to loss of investor confidence and
icapital flight, though it has also been argued that the sanctions had little
ito no effect on Russia's economy.[336][337][338] In 2014, the Organized Crime
iand Corruption Reporting Project named Putin their Person of the Year for
ifurthering corruption and organized crime.[339][340]
i
iAccording to Meduza, Putin has since 2007 predicted on a number of occasions
ithat Russia will become one of the world's five largest economies. In 2013,
ihe
isaid Russia was one of the five biggest economies in terms of gross domestic
iproduct but still lagged behind other countries on indicators such as labour
iproductivity.[341]
i
iIn 2004, Putin signed the Kyoto Protocol treaty designed to reduce greenhouse
igas emissions.[342] However, Russia did not face mandatory cuts, because the
iKyoto Protocol limits emissions to a percentage increase or decrease from
i1990
ilevels and Russia's greenhouse-gas emissions fell well below the 1990
ibaseline
idue to a drop in economic output after the breakup of the Soviet Union.[343]
i
iPutin regularly attends the most important services of the Russian Orthodox
iChurch on the main holy days, and has established a good relationship with
iPatriarchs of the Russian Church, the late Alexy II of Moscow and the current
iKirill of Moscow. As president, Putin took an active personal part in
ipromoting the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate, signed
i17 May 2007, which restored relations between the Moscow-based Russian
iOrthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia after the
i80-year schism.[344]
i
iUnder Putin, the Hasidic Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia became
iincreasingly influential within the Jewish community, partly due to the
iinfluence of Federation-supporting businessmen mediated through their
ialliances with Putin, notably Lev Leviev and Roman Abramovich.[345][346]
iAccording to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Putin is popular amongst the
iRussian Jewish community, who see him as a force for stability. Russia's
ichief
irabbi, Berel Lazar, said Putin "paid great attention to the needs of our
icommunity and related to us with a deep respect".[347] In 2016, Ronald S.
iLauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, also praised Putin for
imaking Russia "a country where Jews are welcome".[348]
i
iHuman rights organizations and religious freedom advocates have criticized
ithe state of religious freedom in Russia.[349] In 2016, Putin oversaw the
ipassage of legislation that prohibited missionary activity in Russia.[349]
iNonviolent religious minority groups have been repressed under anti-extremism
ilaws, especially Jehovah's Witnesses.[350]
i
iOne of the 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia has a constitutional
ireference to God.[351]
i
iThe resumption of long-distance flights of Russia's strategic bombers was
ifollowed by the announcement by Russian Defense Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov
iduring his meeting with Putin on 5 December 2007, that 11 ships, including
ithe
iaircraft carrier Kuznetsov, would take part in the first major navy sortie
iinto the Mediterranean since Soviet times.[352][353]
i
iWhile from the early 2000s Russia started placing more money into its
imilitary and defense industry, it was only in 2008 that full-scale Russian
imilitary reform began, aiming to modernize the Russian Armed Forces and make
ithem significantly more effective. The reform was largely carried out by
iDefense Minister Serdyukov during Medvedev's presidency, under the
isupervision
iof both Putin, as the head of government, and Medvedev, as the
icommander-in-chief of the Russian Armed Forces.[citation needed]
i
iKey elements of the reform included reducing the armed forces to a strength
iof one million, reducing the number of officers, centralising officer
itraining
ifrom 65 military schools into 10 'systemic' military training centres,
icreating a professional NCO corps, reducing the size of the central command,
iintroducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff, elimination of
icadre-strength formations, reorganising the reserves, reorganising the army
iinto a brigade system, and reorganising air forces into an airbase system
iinstead of regiments.[citation needed]
i
iAccording to the Kremlin, Putin embarked on a build-up of Russia's nuclear
icapabilities because of U.S. President George W. Bush's unilateral decision
ito
iwithdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.[355] To counter what
iPutin sees as the United States' goal of undermining Russia's strategic
inuclear deterrent, Moscow has embarked on a program to develop new weapons
icapable of defeating any new American ballistic missile defense or
iinterception system. Some analysts believe that this nuclear strategy under
iPutin has brought Russia into violation of the 1987 Intermediate-Range
iNuclear
iForces Treaty.[356]
i
iAccordingly, U.S. President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would no longer
iconsider itself bound by the treaty's provisions, raising nuclear tensions
ibetween the two powers.[356] This prompted Putin to state that Russia would
inot launch first in a nuclear conflict but that "an aggressor should know
ithat
ivengeance is inevitable, that he will be annihilated, and we would be the
ivictims of the aggression. We will go to heaven as martyrs".[357]
i
iPutin has also sought to increase Russian territorial claims in the Arctic
iand its military presence there. In August 2007, Russian expedition Arktika
i2007, part of research related to the 2001 Russian territorial extension
iclaim, planted a flag on the seabed at the North Pole.[358] Both Russian
isubmarines and troops deployed in the Arctic have been increasing.[359][360]
i
iNew York City-based NGO Human Rights Watch, in a report entitled Laws of
iAttrition, authored by Hugh Williamson, the British director of HRW's Europe
i&
iCentral Asia Division, has claimed that since May 2012, when Putin was
ireelected as president, Russia has enacted many restrictive laws, started
iinspections of non-governmental organizations, harassed, intimidated and
iimprisoned political activists, and started to restrict critics. The new laws
iinclude the "foreign agents" law, which is widely regarded as over-broad by
iincluding Russian human rights organizations which receive some international
igrant funding, the treason law, and the assembly law which penalizes many
iexpressions of dissent.[361][362] Human rights activists have criticized
iRussia for censoring speech of LGBT activists due to "the gay propaganda
ilaw"[363] and increasing violence against LGBT+ people due to the
ilaw.[364][365][366]
i
iIn 2020, Putin signed a law on labelling individuals and organizations
ireceiving funding from abroad as "foreign agents". The law is an expansion of
i"foreign agent" legislation adopted in 2012.[367][368]
i
iAs of June 2020, per Memorial Human Rights Center, there were 380 political
iprisoners in Russia, including 63 individuals prosecuted, directly or
iindirectly, for political activities (including Alexey Navalny) and 245
iprosecuted for their involvement with one of the Muslim organizations that
iare
ibanned in Russia. 78 individuals on the list, i.e. more than 20% of the
itotal,
iare residents of Crimea.[369][370] As of December 2022, more than 4,000
ipeople
iwere prosecuted for criticizing the war in Ukraine under Russia's war
icensorship laws.[371]
i
iScott Gehlbach, a professor of Political Science at the University of
iWisconsin–Madison, has claimed that since 1999, Putin has systematically
ipunished journalists who challenge his official point of view.[373] Maria
iLipman, an American writing in Foreign Affairs claims, "The crackdown that
ifollowed Putin's return to the Kremlin in 2012 extended to the liberal media,
iwhich had until then been allowed to operate fairly independently."[374] The
iInternet has attracted Putin's attention because his critics have tried to
iuse
iit to challenge his control of information.[375] Marian K. Leighton, who
iworked for the CIA as a Soviet analyst in the 1980s says, "Having muzzled
iRussia's print and broadcast media, Putin focused his energies on the
iInternet."[376]
i
iRobert W. Orttung and Christopher Walker reported that "Reporters Without
iBorders, for instance, ranked Russia 148 in its 2013 list of 179 countries in
iterms of freedom of the press. It particularly criticized Russia for the
icrackdown on the political opposition and the failure of the authorities to
ivigorously pursue and bring to justice criminals who have murdered
ijournalists. Freedom House ranks Russian media as "not free", indicating that
ibasic safeguards and guarantees for journalists and media enterprises are
iabsent."[377] About two-thirds of Russians use television as their primary
isource of daily news.[378]
i
iIn the early 2000s, Putin and his circle began promoting the idea in Russian
imedia that they are the modern-day version of the 17th-century Romanov tsars
iwho ended Russia's "Time of Troubles", meaning they claim to be the
ipeacemakers and stabilizers after the fall of the Soviet Union.[379]
i
iFormer
i
iPutin has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural, and
ipolitical matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and
ineoliberalism, and is identified by scholars with Russian conservatism.[380]
iPutin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded
iintellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by
ithe conservative right-wing journalist Alexander Prokhanov, stresses (i)
iRussian nationalism, (ii) the restoration of Russia's historical greatness,
iand (iii) systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.[381] Vladislav
iSurkov, a senior government official, has been one of the key economics
iconsultants during Putin's presidency.[382]
i
iIn cultural and social affairs Putin has collaborated closely with the
iRussian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the Church,
iendorsed his election in 2012 stating Putin's terms were like "a miracle of
iGod."[383] Steven Myers reports, "The church, once heavily repressed, had
iemerged from the Soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions...
iNow Kiril led the faithful directly into an alliance with the state."[384]
i
iMark Woods, a Baptist Union of Great Britain minister and contributing editor
ito Christian Today, provides specific examples of how the Church has backed
ithe expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine.[385] Some
iRussian Orthodox believers consider Putin a corrupt and brutal strongman or
ieven a tyrant. Others do not admire him, but appreciate that he aggravates
itheir political opponents. Still others appreciate that Putin defends some
ialthough not all Orthodox teachings, whether or not he believes in them
ihimself.[386]
i
iOn abortion, Putin stated: "In the modern world, the decision is up to the
iwoman herself."[387] This put him at odds with the Russian Orthodox
iChurch.[388][389] In 2020, he supported efforts to reduce the number of
iabortions instead of prohibiting it.[390]
i
iPutin supported the 2020 Russian constitutional referendum, which passed and
idefined marriage as a relationship between one man and one woman in the
iConstitution of Russia.[391][392][393]
i
iIn 2007, Putin led a successful effort on behalf of Sochi for the 2014 Winter
iOlympics and the 2014 Winter Paralympics,[394] the first Winter Olympic Games
ito ever be hosted by Russia. In 2008, the city of Kazan won the bid for the
i2013 Summer Universiade; on 2 December 2010, Russia won the right to host the
i2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup, also for the first time
iin Russian history. In 2013, Putin stated that gay athletes would not face
iany
idiscrimination at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.[395]
i
i===== Foreign policy =====
i
iIn her 2022 book, Anna Borshchevskaya summarizes Putin main foreign policy
iobjectives as originating in his 30 December 1999 document which appeared on
ithe government's website, "Russia at the Turn of the Millenium".[396] She
ipresents Putin as orienting himself to the plan that "Russia is a country
iwith
iunique values in danger of losing its unity—which... is a historic Russian
ifear. This again points to the fundamental issue of Russia's identity
iissues—and how the state had manipulated these to drive anti-Western security
inarratives with the aim of eroding the US-led global order... Moreover, a
ilook
iat Russia's distribution of forces over the years under Putin has been
iheavily
iweighted towards the south (Syria, Ukraine, Middle East), another indicator
iof
ithe Kremlin's threat perceptions."[397][398]
i
iLeonid Bershidsky analyzed Putin's interview with the Financial Times and
iconcluded, "Putin is an imperialist of the old Soviet school, rather than a
inationalist or a racist, and he has cooperated with, and promoted, people who
iare known to be gay."[399] Putin spoke favorably of artificial intelligence
iin
iregards to foreign policy, "Artificial intelligence is the future, not only
ifor Russia, but for all humankind. It comes with colossal opportunities, but
ialso threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in
ithis
isphere will become the ruler of the world."[400]
i
iIn 2012, Putin wrote an article in Indian newspaper The Hindu, saying: "The
iDeclaration on Strategic Partnership between India and Russia signed in
iOctober 2000 became a truly historic step."[401][402] India remains the
ilargest customer of Russian military equipment, and the two countries share a
ihistorically strong strategic and diplomatic relationship.[403] In October
i2022, Putin described India and China as "close allies and partners".[404]
i
iUnder Putin, Russia has maintained positive relations with the Asian states
iof SCO and BRICS, which include China, India, Pakistan, and post-Soviet
istates
iof Central Asia.[405][406] In the 21st century, Sino-Russian relations have
isignificantly strengthened bilaterally and economically—the Treaty of
iFriendship, and the construction of the ESPO oil pipeline and the Power of
iSiberia gas pipeline formed a "special relationship" between the two great
ipowers.[407]
i
iPutin and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe frequently met each other to discuss the
iJapan–Russia territorial disputes. Putin also voiced his willingness of
iconstructing a rail bridge between the two countries.[408] Despite the amount
iof meetings, no agreement was signed before Abe's resignation in
i2020.[409][410]
i
iPutin made three visits to Mongolia and has enjoyed good relations with its
ineighbor. Putin and his Mongolian counterpart signed a permanent treaty on
ifriendship between the two states in September 2019, further enhancing trade
iand cultural exchanges.[411][412] Putin became the first Russian or Soviet
ileader to visit Indonesia in half a century in 2007, resulting in the signing
iof an arms deal.[413] In another visit, Putin commented on long-standing ties
iand friendship between Russia and Indonesia.[414] Russia has also boosted
irelations with Vietnam after 2011,[415][416] and with Afghanistan in the
i2010s, giving military and economic aid.[417][418] The relations between
iRussia and the Philippines received a boost in 2016 as Putin forged closer
ibilateral ties with his Filipino counterpart, Rodrigo Duterte.[419][420]
iPutin
ialso has good relations with Malaysia and its then Prime Minister Mahathir
iMohamad,[421] as well as with Bangladesh,[422] signing a nuclear power deal
iwith Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.[423] Putin also made the first
iRussian or Soviet leader to visit North Korea, meeting Kim Jong-il in July
i2000, shortly after a visit to South Korea.[424]
i
iPutin criticized violence in Myanmar against Rohingya minorities in
i2017.[425] Following the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état, Russia has pledged to
iboost
ities with the Myanmar military regime.[426]
i
iUnder Putin, the Kremlin has consistently stated that Russia has a sphere of
iinfluence and "privileged interests" over other Post-Soviet states, which are
ireferred to as the "near abroad" in Russia. It has also been stated that the
ipost-Soviet states are strategically vital to Russian interests.[427] Some
iRussia experts have compared this concept to the Monroe Doctrine.[428]
i
iA series of so-called colour revolutions in the post-Soviet states, namely
ithe Rose Revolution in Georgia in 2003, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in
i2004 and the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan in 2005, led to frictions in the
irelations of those countries with Russia. In December 2004, Putin criticized
ithe Rose and Orange revolutions, saying: "If you have permanent revolutions
iyou risk plunging the post-Soviet space into endless conflict".[429]
i
iPutin allegedly declared at a NATO-Russia summit in 2008 that if Ukraine
ijoined NATO Russia could contend to annex the Ukrainian East and Crimea.[430]
iAt the summit, he told U.S. President George W. Bush that "Ukraine is not
ieven
ia state!" while the following year Putin referred to Ukraine as "Little
iRussia".[431] Following the Revolution of Dignity in March 2014, the Russian
iFederation annexed Crimea.[432][433][434] According to Putin, this was done
ibecause "Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of
iRussia".[435]
i
iAfter the Russian annexation of Crimea, he said that Ukraine includes
i"regions of Russia's historic south" and "was created on a whim by the
iBolsheviks".[436] He went on to declare that the February 2014 ousting of
iUkrainian President Viktor Yanukovych had been orchestrated by the West as an
iattempt to weaken Russia. "Our Western partners have crossed a line. They
ibehaved rudely, irresponsibly and unprofessionally," he said, adding that the
ipeople who had come to power in Ukraine were "nationalists, neo-Nazis,
iRussophobes and anti-Semites".[436]
i
iIn a July 2014 speech during a Russian-supported armed insurgency in Eastern
iUkraine, Putin stated he would use Russia's "entire arsenal of available
imeans" up to "operations under international humanitarian law and the right
iof
iself-defence" to protect Russian speakers outside Russia.[437][438] With the
iattainment of autocephaly by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in December 2018
iand subsequent schism of the Russian Orthodox Church from Constantinople, a
inumber of experts came to the conclusion that Putin's policy of forceful
iengagement in post-Soviet republics significantly backfired on him, leading
ito
ia situation where he "annexed Crimea, but lost Ukraine", and provoked a much
imore cautious approach to Russia among other post-Soviet countries.[439][440]
i
iIn late August 2014, Putin stated: "People who have their own views on
ihistory and the history of our country may argue with me, but it seems to me
ithat the Russian and Ukrainian peoples are practically one people".[441]
iAfter
imaking a similar statement, in late December 2015 he stated: "the Ukrainian
iculture, as well as Ukrainian literature, surely has a source of its
iown".[442] In July 2021, he published a lengthy article On the Historical
iUnity of Russians and Ukrainians[443] revisiting these themes, and saying the
iformation of a Ukrainian state hostile to Moscow was "comparable in its
iconsequences to the use of weapons of mass destruction against
ius",[444][445]—it was made mandatory reading for military-political training
iin the Russian Armed Forces.[446]
i
iIn August 2008, Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili attempted to restore
icontrol over the breakaway South Ossetia. However, the Georgian military was
isoon defeated in the resulting 2008 South Ossetia War after regular Russian
iforces entered South Ossetia and then other parts of Georgia, then also
iopened
ia second front in the other Georgian breakaway province of Abkhazia with
iAbkhazian forces.[447][448]
i
iDespite existing or past tensions between Russia and most of the post-Soviet
istates, Putin has followed the policy of Eurasian integration. Putin endorsed
ithe idea of a Eurasian Union in 2011;[449][450] the concept was proposed by
ithe president of Kazakhstan in 1994.[451] On 18 November 2011, the presidents
iof Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia signed an agreement setting a target of
iestablishing the Eurasian Union by 2015.[452] The Eurasian Union was
iestablished on 1 January 2015.[453]
i
iUnder Putin, Russia's relations have improved significantly with Uzbekistan,
ithe second largest post-Soviet republic after Ukraine. This was demonstrated
iin Putin's visit to Tashkent in May 2000, after lukewarm relations under
iYeltsin and Islam Karimov who had long distanced itself from Moscow.[454] In
ianother meeting in 2014, Russia agreed to write off Uzbek debt.[455]
i
iA theme of a greater Soviet region, including the former USSR and many of its
ineighbors or imperial-era states⸺rather than just post-Soviet Russia⸺has been
iconsistent in Putin's May Day speeches.[456][457][458]
i
iOn 22 December 2022, Putin addressed the Security Council in a speech where
ihe did not use the term "Special Military Operation" but instead called the
ifighting in Ukraine a "war". Anti-Putin activists have called for Putin to be
iprosecuted for breaking a law passed to stop people calling the Special
iMilitary Operation a war. This law carries a penalty of up to 15 years in
ijail.[459]
i
iOn 25 December, he openly declared in a TV interview that the goal of the
iinvasion is "to unite the Russian people."[460]
i
iUnder Putin, Russia's relationships with NATO and the U.S. have passed
ithrough several stages. When he first became president, relations were
icautious, but after the 9/11 attacks Putin quickly supported the U.S. in the
iWar on Terror and the opportunity for partnership appeared.[462] According to
iStephen F. Cohen, the U.S. "repaid by further expansion of NATO to Russia's
iborders and by unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
iTreaty",[462] but others pointed out the applications from new countries
iwilling to join NATO was driven primarily by Russian's behavior in Chechnya,
iTransnistria, Abkhazia, Yanayev putsch as well as calls to restore USSR in
iits
iprevious borders by prominent Russian politicians.[463][464]
i
iFrom 2003, when Russia strongly opposed the U.S. when it waged the Iraq War,
iPutin became ever more distant from the West, and relations steadily
ideteriorated. According to Russia scholar Stephen F. Cohen, the narrative of
ithe mainstream U.S. media, following that of the White House, became
ianti-Putin.[462] In an interview with Michael Stürmer, Putin said there were
ithree questions which most concerned Russia and Eastern Europe: namely, the
istatus of Kosovo, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and
iAmerican plans to build missile defence sites in Poland and the Czech
iRepublic, and suggested that all three were linked.[465] His view was that
iconcessions by the West on one of the questions might be met with concessions
ifrom Russia on another.[465]
i
iOne single center of power. One single center of force. One single center of
idecision making. This is the world of one master, one sovereign. ...
iPrimarily
ithe United States has overstepped its national borders, and in every area.
i
i— Putin criticizing the United States in his Munich Speech, 2007[466]
i
iIn a January 2007 interview, Putin said Russia was in favor of a democratic
imultipolar world and strengthening the systems of international law.[467] In
iFebruary 2007, Putin criticized what he called the United States'
imonopolistic
idominance in global relations, and "almost uncontained hyper use of force in
iinternational relations". He said the result of it is that "no one feels
isafe!
iBecause no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will
iprotect them. Of course such a policy stimulates an arms race".[468] This
icame
ito be known as the Munich Speech, and NATO secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer
icalled the speech "disappointing and not helpful."[469]
i
iThe months following Putin's Munich Speech[468] were marked by tension and a
isurge in rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic. Both Russian and American
iofficials, however, denied the idea of a new Cold War.[470] Putin publicly
iopposed plans for the U.S. missile shield in Europe and presented President
iGeorge W. Bush with a counterproposal on 7 June 2007 which was declined.[471]
iRussia suspended its participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe
itreaty
ion 11 December 2007.[472]
i
iPutin opposed Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia on
i17 February 2008, warning that it would destabilize the whole system of
iinternational relations.[473][better source needed] He described the
irecognition of Kosovo's independence by several major world powers as "a
iterrible precedent, which will de facto blow apart the whole system of
iinternational relations, developed not over decades, but over centuries", and
ithat "they have not thought through the results of what they are doing. At
ithe
iend of the day it is a two-ended stick and the second end will come back and
ihit them in the face".[474] In March 2014, Putin used Kosovo's declaration of
iindependence as a justification for recognizing the independence of Crimea,
iciting the so-called "Kosovo independence precedent".[475][476]
i
iAfter the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. in 2001, Putin had good relations with
iAmerican President George W. Bush, and many western European leaders. His
i"cooler" and "more business-like" relationship with German chancellor, Angela
iMerkel is often attributed to Merkel's upbringing in the former DDR, where
iPutin was stationed as a KGB agent.[477] He had a very friendly and warm
irelationship with the former Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi;[478]
ithe two leaders often described their relationship as a close friendship,
icontinuing to organize bilateral meetings even after Berlusconi's resignation
iin November 2011.[479] When Berlusconi died in 2023, Putin described him as
ian
i"extraordinary man" and a "true friend".[480][481]
i
iThe NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011 prompted a widespread
iwave of criticism from several world leaders, including Putin, who said that
ithe United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 is "defective and
iflawed",
iadding: "It allows everything. It resembles medieval calls for
icrusades."[482]
i
iIn late 2013, Russian-American relations deteriorated further when the United
iStates canceled a summit for the first time since 1960 after Putin gave
iasylum
ito American Edward Snowden, who had leaked massive amounts of classified
iinformation from the NSA.[483][484] In 2014, Russia was suspended from the G8
igroup as a result of its annexation of Crimea.[485][486] Putin gave a speech
ihighly critical of the United States, accusing them of destabilizing world
iorder and trying to "reshape the world" to its own benefit.[487] In June
i2015,
iPutin said that Russia has no intention of attacking NATO.[488]
i
iOn 9 November 2016, Putin congratulated Donald Trump on becoming the 45th
ipresident of the United States.[490] In December 2016, US intelligence
iofficials (headed by James Clapper) quoted by CBS News stated that Putin
iapproved the email hacking and cyber attacks during the U.S. election,
iagainst
ithe Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. A spokesman for Putin
idenied the reports.[491] Putin has repeatedly accused Hillary Clinton, who
iserved as U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, of interfering in
iRussia's internal affairs,[492] and in December 2016, Clinton accused Putin
iof
ihaving a personal grudge against her.[493][494]
i
iWith the election of Trump, Putin's favorability in the U.S. increased. A
iGallup poll in February 2017 revealed a positive view of Putin among 22% of
iAmericans, the highest since 2003.[495] Putin has stated that U.S.–Russian
irelations, already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War,[496]
ihave continued to deteriorate after Trump took office in January 2017.[497]
i
iOn 18 June 2020, The National Interest published a nine thousand word essay
iby Putin, titled "The Real Lessons of the 75th Anniversary of World War
iII".[498] In the essay, Putin criticizes the Western historical view of the
iMolotov–Ribbentrop Pact as the start of World War II, stating that the Munich
iAgreement was the beginning.[499]
i
iOn 21 February 2023, Putin suspended Russia's participation in the New START
inuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States.[500]
i
iOn 25 March, President Putin announced the stationing of tactical nuclear
iweapons in Belarus. Russia would maintain control of the weapons. President
iPutin told Russian TV: "There is nothing unusual here either…Firstly, the
iUnited States has been doing this for decades. They have long deployed their
itactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries."[501]
i
iIn 2003, relations between Russia and the United Kingdom deteriorated when
ithe United Kingdom granted political asylum to Putin's former patron,
ioligarch
iBoris Berezovsky.[502] This deterioration was intensified by allegations that
ithe British were spying and making secret payments to pro-democracy and human
irights groups.[503] A survey conducted in the United Kingdom in 2022 found
iPutin to be among the least popular foreign leaders, with 8% of British
irespondents holding a positive opinion.[504]
i
iThe end of 2006 brought more strained relations in the wake of the death by
ipolonium poisoning in London of former KGB and FSB officer Alexander
iLitvinenko, who became an MI6 agent in 2003. In 2007, the crisis in relations
icontinued with the expulsion of four Russian envoys over Russia's refusal to
iextradite former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi to face charges in the
imurder.[502] Mirroring the British actions, Russia expelled UK diplomats and
itook other retaliatory steps.[502]
i
iIn 2015, the British Government launched a public inquiry into Litvinenko's
ideath, presided over by Robert Owen, a former British High Court judge.[505]
iThe Owen report, published on 21 January 2016, stated "The FSB operation to
ikill Mr. Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr Patrushev and also by
iPresident Putin."[506] The report outlined some possible motives for the
imurder, including Litvinenko's public statements and books about the alleged
iinvolvement of the FSB in mass murder, and what was "undoubtedly a personal
idimension to the antagonism" between Putin and Litvinenko.[507]
i
iOn 4 March 2018, former double agent Sergei Skripal was poisoned with a
iNovichok nerve agent in Salisbury.[508] Ten days later, the British
igovernment
iformally accused the Russian state of attempted murder, a charge which Russia
idenied.[509] After the UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats (an action which
iwould
ilater be responded to with a Russian expulsion of 23 British diplomats),[510]
iBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on 16 March that it was
i"overwhelmingly likely" Putin had personally ordered the poisoning of
iSkripal.
iPutin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the allegation "shocking and
iunpardonable diplomatic misconduct".[511]
i
iPutin and his successor, Medvedev, enjoyed warm relations with Hugo Chávez of
iVenezuela. Much of this has been through the sale of military equipment;
isince
i2005, Venezuela has purchased more than $4 billion worth of arms from
iRussia.[512] In September 2008, Russia sent Tupolev Tu-160 bombers to
iVenezuela to carry out training flights.[513] In November 2008, both
icountries
iheld a joint naval exercise in the Caribbean. Earlier in 2000, Putin had
ire-established stronger ties with Fidel Castro's Cuba.[514]
i
i"You express the best masculine qualities," Putin told Jair Bolsonaro in
i2020. "You look for solutions in all matters, always putting above all the
iinterests of your people, your country, leaving out your own personal
iissues."
iPolitical scientist Oliver Stuenkel noted, "Among Brazil's right-wing
ipopulists, Putin is seen as someone who is anti-woke, and that is seen as
isomething that is definitely appealing to Bolsonaro. He is a strongman, and
ithat is very inspiring to Bolsonaro. He would like to be someone who
iconcentrates as much power."[515]
i
iIn September 2007, Putin visited Indonesia and in doing so became the first
iRussian leader to visit the country in more than 50 years.[516] In the same
imonth, Putin also attended the APEC meeting held in Sydney, Australia, where
ihe met with Prime Minister John Howard, and signed a uranium trade deal for
iAustralia to sell uranium to Russia. This was the first visit by a Russian
ipresident to Australia.[517] Putin again visited Australia for 2014 G20
iBrisbane summit. The Abbott government denounced Putin's use of military
iforce
iin Ukraine in 2014 as "bullying" and "utterly unacceptable".[518]
i
iAmid calls to ban Putin from attending the 2014 G20 Summit, Prime Minister
iTony Abbott said he would "shirtfront" (challenge) the Russian leader over
ithe
ishooting down of MH17 by Russian-backed rebels, which had killed 38
iAustralians.[519] Putin denied responsibility for the killings.[520]
i
iFollowing Putin's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Australian Prime Minister
iScott Morrison said the invasion was "unprovoked, unjust and illegal" and
ilabeled Putin a "thug".[521] New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern
idenounced Putin as a "bully".[522] Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama
itweeted "Fiji and our fellow Pacific Island Countries have united as nations
iof peace-loving people to condemn the conflict in Ukraine", while the Solomon
iIslands UN ambassador called the invasion a "violation of the rule of
ilaw".[523]
i
iOn 16 October 2007, Putin visited Iran to participate in the Second Caspian
iSummit in Tehran,[524][525] where he met with Iranian president Mahmoud
iAhmadinejad.[526][527] This was the first visit of a Soviet or Russian
ileader[528] to Iran since Joseph Stalin's participation in the Tehran
iConference in 1943, and marked a significant event in Iran–Russia
irelations.[529] At a press conference after the summit Putin said that "all
iour (Caspian) states have the right to develop their peaceful nuclear
iprogrammes without any restrictions".[530]
i
iPutin was quoted as describing Iran as a "partner",[465] though he expressed
iconcerns over the Iranian nuclear programme.[465]
i
iIn April 2008, Putin became the first Russian president to visit Libya.[531]
iPutin condemned the 2011 foreign military intervention in Libya, referring to
ithe UN resolution as "defective and flawed," and added "It allows everything.
iIt resembles medieval calls for crusades."[532] Upon the death of Muammar
iGaddafi, Putin called it as "planned murder" by the US, saying: "They showed
ito the whole world how he (Gaddafi) was killed," and "There was blood all
iover. Is that what they call a democracy?"[533][534]
i
iFrom 2000 to 2010, Russia sold around $1.5 billion worth of arms to Syria,
imaking Damascus Moscow's seventh-largest client.[535] During the Syrian civil
iwar, Russia threatened to veto any sanctions against the Syrian
igovernment,[536] and continued to supply arms to its regime.
i
iPutin opposed any foreign intervention in the Syrian civil war. In June 2012,
iin Paris, he rejected the statement of French president François Hollande who
icalled on Bashar al-Assad to step down. Putin echoed Assad's argument that
ianti-regime militants were responsible for much of the bloodshed. He also
italked about previous NATO interventions and their results, and asked "What
iis
ihappening in Libya, in Iraq? Did they become safer? Where are they heading?
iNobody has an answer".[537]
i
iOn 11 September 2013, The New York Times published an op-ed by Putin urging
icaution against US intervention in Syria and criticizing American
iexceptionalism.[539] Putin subsequently helped to arrange for the destruction
iof Syria's chemical weapons.[540] In 2015, he took a stronger pro-Assad
istance[541] and mobilized military support for the regime. Some analysts have
isummarized Putin as being allied with Shiites and Alawites in the Middle
iEast.[542][543]
i
iIn 2017, Putin dispatched Russian PMCs to back the Touadéra regime in the
iCentral African Republic Civil War, gaining a permanent military presence in
ireturn.[h]
i
iThe first Russia-Africa Summit was held on 23–24 October 2019 in Sochi,
iRussia, co-hosted by Putin and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.[544]
iThe meeting was attended by 43 heads of state and government from African
icountries.[545]
i
iIn October 2019, Putin visited the United Arab Emirates, where six agreements
iwere struck with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. One of them
iincluded shared investments between Russian sovereign wealth fund and the
iEmirati investment fund Mubadala. The two nations signed deals worth over
i$1.3bn, in energy, health and advance technology sectors.[546]
i
iOn 22 October 2021, Putin highlighted the "unique bond" between Russia and
iIsrael during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.[547]
i
i===== Public image =====
i
iThe director of the Levada Center, Denis Volkov, stated in 2015 that drawing
iany conclusions from Russian poll results or comparing them to polls in
idemocratic states was pointless as there is no real political competition in
iRussia, where, unlike in democratic states, Russian voters are not offered
iany
i"credible alternatives" and public opinion is primarily formed by
istate-controlled media which promotes those in power and discredits any
ialternative candidates.[548]
i
iIn a June 2007 public opinion survey, Putin's approval rating was 81%, the
isecond-highest of any leader in the world that year.[549] In January 2013, at
ithe time of the 2011–2013 Russian protests, Putin's approval rating fell to
i62%, the lowest figure since 2000 and a ten-point drop over two years.[550]
i
iIn May 2014, Putin's approval rating hit 83%, its highest since 2008. After
iEU and U.S. sanctions against Russian officials as a result of the crisis in
iUkraine, Putin's approval rating reached 87%, in a survey published on 6
iAugust 2014.[551] In February 2015, based on new domestic polling, Putin was
iranked the world's most popular politician.[552] In June 2015, Putin's
iapproval rating climbed to 89%, an all-time high.[553][554][555] In 2016, his
iapproval rating was 81%.[556]
i
iObservers saw Putin's high approval ratings in 2010's as a consequence of
isignificant improvements in living standards, and Russia's reassertion of
iitself on the world scene during his presidency.[557][558]
i
iDespite high approval for Putin, public confidence in the Russian economy was
ilow, dropping to levels in 2016 that rivaled the recent lows in 2009 at the
iheight of the global economic crisis. Just 14% of Russians in 2016 said their
inational economy was getting better, and 18% said this about their local
ieconomies.[559]
i
iPutin's performance in reining in corruption is unpopular among Russians.
iNewsweek reported in June 2017 that "An opinion poll by the Moscow-based
iLevada Center indicated that 67 percent held Putin personally responsible for
ihigh-level corruption".[560] Corruption is a significant problem in
iRussia.[561][562]
i
iIn July 2018, Putin's approval rating fell to 63% and just 49% would vote for
iPutin if presidential elections were held.[564] Levada poll results published
iin September 2018 showed Putin's personal trustworthiness levels at 39% (a
idecline from 59% in November 2017)[565] with the main contributing factor
ibeing the presidential support of the unpopular pension reform and economic
istagnation.[566][567] In October 2018, two-thirds of Russians surveyed in the
iLevada poll agreed that "Putin bears full responsibility for the problems of
ithe country" which has been attributed[568] to a decline in a popular belief
iin "good tsar and bad boyars", a traditional attitude towards justifying
ifailures at the top of the ruling hierarchy in Russia.[569]
i
iIn January 2019, the percentage of Russians trusting Putin hit a
ithen-historic minimum – 33.4%.[570] It declined to 31.7% in May 2019.[571]
iThis finding led to a dispute between the VCIOM and President's
iadministration
ioffice, who accused it of incorrectly using an open question, after which
iVCIOM repeated the poll with a closed question getting 72.3%.[572]
iNonetheless, in April 2019 Gallup poll showed a record number of Russians
i(20%) willing to permanently emigrate from Russia.[573]
i
iThe decline is even larger in the 17–25 age group, "who find themselves
ilargely disconnected from the country's aging leadership, nostalgic Soviet
irhetoric and nepotistic agenda", according to a report prepared by Vladimir
iMilov. Putin's approval rating among young Russians was 32% in January 2019.
iThe percentage of people willing to emigrate permanently in this age group
iwas
i41%. 60% had favorable views of the United States (three times more than in
ithe 55+ age group).[574] Decline in support for the president and the
igovernment is visible in other polls, such as a rapidly growing readiness to
iprotest against poor living conditions.[572]
i
iIn May 2020, amid the COVID-19 crisis, Putin's approval rating was 67.9%,
imeasured by VCIOM when respondents were presented a list of names (closed
iquestion),[575] and 27% when respondents were expected to name politicians
ithey trust (open question).[576] In a closed-question survey conducted by the
iLevada Center, Putin's approval rating was 59%.[577] This has been attributed
ito continued post-Crimea economic stagnation but also an apathetic response
ito
ithe pandemic crisis in Russia.[578]
i
iIn another May 2021 Levada poll, 33% indicated Putin in response to "who
iwould you vote for this weekend?" among Moscow respondents and 40% outside of
iMoscow.[579] The Levada Center survey released in October 2021 found 53% of
irespondents saying they trusted Putin.[580]
i
iSome observers noted what they described as a "generational struggle" among
iRussians over perception of Putin's rule, with younger Russians more likely
ito
ibe against Putin and his policies and older Russians more likely to accept
ithe
inarrative presented by state-controlled media in Russia.[581] Putin's support
iamong Russians aged 18–24 was only 20% in December 2020.[582]
i
iPolls conducted in November 2021 in the wake of the failure of a Russian
iCOVID-19 vaccination campaign indicated that distrust of Putin personally is
ione of the major contributing factors for vaccine hesitancy among citizens,
iwith regional polls indicating numbers as low as 20–30% in the Volga Federal
iDistrict.[584]
i
iFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, state-controlled
itelevision channels, which most Russians get their news from, presented the
iinvasion as a "special military operation" and a liberation mission in line
iwith the government's narrative.[585][586][587][588][589] The Russian
icensorship apparatus Roskomnadzor ordered the country's media to employ
iinformation only from Russian state sources or face fines and blocks.[590]
iThe
iRussian media was banned from using the words "war", "invasion" or
i"aggression" to describe the "special military operation",[586] with various
imedia outlets being blocked as a result.[591]
i
iOn 26–28 February 2022, a survey conducted by the independent research group
iRussian Field found that 58.8% of respondents supported the "special military
ioperation" in Ukraine.[592] According to the poll, in the group of
i18-to-24-year-olds, only 29% supported the "special military operation".[593]
iIn late February and mid-March 2022 with an interval of one and a half weeks,
itwo polls conducted by a group of independent Russian sociologists[who?]
isurveyed Russians' sentiments about the "special military operation" in
iUkraine. The results of the poll were obtained by Radio Liberty.[594] Almost
ithree-quarters (71%) of Russians polled declared that they supported the
i"special military operation" in Ukraine.[595][594]
i
iWhen asked how they were affected by the actions of Putin, a third of
irespondents said they strongly believed that Putin was working in their
iinterests. Another 26 percent said that he was working in their interests to
isome extent. In general, most Russians believe that it would be better if
iPutin remained president for as long as possible.[595][594] Similarly, a
itelephone survey conducted by independent researchers from 28 February to 1
iMarch found that 58% of Russian respondents approved of the military
ioperation.[596][597]
i
iIn March 2022, 97% of Ukrainians said they had an unfavorable view of Putin,
iand 98% of Ukrainians – including 82% of ethnic Russians living in Ukraine –
isaid they did not believe that any part of Ukraine was rightfully part of
iRussia, according to Lord Ashcroft's polls which did not include Crimea and
ithe separatist-controlled part of Donbas.[598]
i
iA poll by the Levada Center published on 30 March saw Putin's approval rating
ijump from 71% in February to 83% in March.[599][600] However, experts warned
ithat the figures may not accurately reflect the public mood, as the public
itends to rally around leaders during war and some may be hiding their true
iopinions,[601] especially with enhanced censorship and the new Russian 2022
iwar censorship laws prohibiting the dissemination of "fake information" about
ithe military.[602] Many respondents do not want to answer pollsters'
iquestions
ifor fear of negative consequences.[592] When a group of researchers
icommissioned a survey on Russians' attitudes to the war in Ukraine, 29,400 of
ithe 31,000 people they called refused to answer when they heard the
iquestion.[603] The Levada Center's director, Denis Volkov, stated that early
ifeelings of "shock and confusion" was being replaced with the belief that
iRussia was being besieged and that Russians must rally around their
ileader.[591]
i
iPutin has cultivated a cult of personality for himself with an outdoorsy,
isporty, tough guy public image, demonstrating his physical prowess and taking
ipart in unusual or dangerous acts, such as extreme sports and interaction
iwith
iwild animals,[604] part of a public relations approach that, according to
iWired, "deliberately cultivates the macho, take-charge superhero image".[605]
iIn 2007, the tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda published a huge photograph of a
ishirtless Putin vacationing in the Siberian mountains under the headline "Be
iLike Putin".[606]
i
iNumerous Kremlinologists have accused Putin of seeking to create a cult of
ipersonality around himself, an accusation that the Kremlin has denied.[607]
iSome of Putin's activities have been criticised for being staged;[608][609]
ioutside of Russia, his macho image has been the subject of
iparody.[610][611][612] Putin's height has been estimated by Kremlin insiders
ito be between 155 and 165 centimetres (5 feet 1 inch and 5 feet 5 inches)
itall
ibut is usually given at 170 centimetres (5 feet 7 inches).[613][614]
i
iThere are many songs about Putin,[615] and Putin's name and image are widely
iused in advertisement and product branding.[605] Among the Putin-branded
iproducts are Putinka vodka, the PuTin brand of canned food, the Gorbusha
iPutina caviar, and a collection of T-shirts with his image.[616] In 2015, his
iadvisor Mikhail Lesin was found dead after "days of excessive consumption of
ialcohol", though his death was later ruled as the result of an accident.[617]
i
iIn 2007, he was the Time Person of the Year.[618][619] In 2015, he was No. 1
ion the Time's Most Influential People List.[620][621] Forbes ranked him the
iWorld's Most Powerful Individual every year from 2013 to 2016.[622] He was
iranked the second most powerful individual by Forbes in 2018.[623]
i
iIn Germany, the word "Putinversteher" (female form "Putinversteherin") is a
ineologism and a political buzzword (Putin + verstehen), which literally
itranslates "Putin understander", i.e., "one who understands Putin".[624] It
iis
ia pejorative reference to politicians and pundits who express empathy to
iPutin
iand may also be translated as "Putin-empathizer".[625]
i
iPutin has produced many aphorisms and catch-phrases known as putinisms.[626]
iMany of them were first made during his annual Q&A conferences, where Putin
ianswered questions from journalists and other people in the studio, as well
ias
ifrom Russians throughout the country, who either phoned in or spoke from
istudios and outdoor sites across Russia. Putin is known for his often tough
iand sharp language, often alluding to Russian jokes and folk sayings.[626]
i
iPutin sometimes uses Russian criminal jargon (known as "fenya" in Russian),
ialbeit not always correctly.[627]
i
i===== Assessments of Putin =====
i
iAssessments of Putin's character as a leader have evolved during his long
ipresidency. His shifting of Russia towards autocracy and weakening of the
isystem of representative government advocated by Boris Yeltsin has met with
icriticism.[628] Russian dissidents and world leaders now frequently
icharacterise him as a "dictator". Others have offered favourable assessments
iof his impact on Russia.
i
iPutin was described in 2015 as a "dictator" by political opponent Garry
iKasparov,[629] and as the "Tsar of corruption" in 2016 by opposition activist
iand blogger Alexei Navalny.[630] He was described as a "bully" and "arrogant"
iby former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton,[631][632][633] and as
i"self-centered" by the Dalai Lama.[634] In 2015, opposition politician Boris
iNemtsov said that Putin was turning Russia into a "raw materials colony" of
iChina.[635]
i
iFormer U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger wrote in 2014 that the West
ihas demonized Putin.[636] Egon Krenz, former leader of East Germany, said the
iCold War never ended, adding: "After weak presidents like Gorbachev and
iYeltsin, it is a great fortune for Russia that it has Putin."[637]
i
iMany Russians credit Putin for reviving Russia's fortunes.[638] Former Soviet
iUnion leader Mikhail Gorbachev, while acknowledging the flawed democratic
iprocedures and restrictions on media freedom during the Putin presidency,
isaid
ithat Putin had pulled Russia out of chaos at the end of the Yeltsin years,
iand
ithat Russians "must remember that Putin saved Russia from the beginning of a
icollapse."[638][639] Chechen Republic head and Putin supporter, Ramzan
iKadyrov, stated prior to 2011 that Putin saved both the Chechen people and
iRussia.[640]
i
iRussia has suffered democratic backsliding during Putin's tenure.[641]
iFreedom House has listed Russia as being "not free" since 2005.[642] Experts
ido not generally consider Russia to be a democracy,[20][643][644] citing
ipurges and jailing of political opponents,[21][645] curtailed press
ifreedom,[646][647][648] and the lack of free and fair
ielections.[649][650][651] In 2004, Freedom House warned that Russia's
i"retreat
ifrom freedom marks a low point not registered since 1989, when the country
iwas
ipart of the Soviet Union."[652]
i
iThe Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Russia as "authoritarian" since
i2011,[653][654] whereas it had previously been considered a "hybrid regime"
i(with "some form of democratic government" in place).[655] According to
ipolitical scientist Larry Diamond, writing in 2015, "no serious scholar would
iconsider Russia today a democracy".[656]
i
iFollowing the jailing of the anti-corruption blogger and activist Alexei
iNavalny in 2018, Forbes wrote: "Putin's actions are those of a dictator... As
ia leader with failing public support, he can only remain in power by using
iforce and repression that gets worse by the day."[657] In November 2021, The
iEconomist also noted that Putin had "shifted from autocracy to
idictatorship".[658]
i
iIn February 2015, former U.S. Ambassador to Germany John Kornblum wrote in
ithe Wall Street Journal that:[659]
i
iWestern nations must start the turnaround by emphatically refuting one of Mr.
iPutin's favorite claims: that the West abrogated the promise of democratic
ipartnership with Russia in the 1990 Paris Charter, a document produced by a
isummit that included European governments, the U.S. and the Soviet Union,
iconvened as Communism crumbled across Eastern Europe... The U.S. and its
iallies didn't rush in after 1990 to exploit a proud but collapsing Soviet
iUnion – a tale that Mr. Putin now spins. I took part in nearly every major
inegotiation of that era. Never was the idea of humbling Russia considered
ieven
ifor a moment. The Russian leaders we encountered were not angry
iPrussian-style
iJunkers who railed against a strategic stab in the back. Many if not all
iviewed the fall of the Soviet Union as liberation rather than defeat...
iContrary to Mr. Putin's fictions about NATO's illegal enlargement, the West
ihas honored the agreements worked out with Russia two decades ago.
i
iFollowing mounting civilian casualties during the Russian invasion of
iUkraine,[661] U.S. president Joe Biden called Putin a war criminal and
i"murderous dictator".[662][663] In the 2022 State of the Union Address, Biden
isaid that Putin had "badly miscalculated".[664] The Ukrainian envoy to the
iUnited Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya likened Putin to Adolf Hitler.[665] Latvian
iprime minister Krisjanis Karins also likened the Russian leader to Hitler,
isaying he was "a deluded autocrat creating misery for millions" and that
i"Putin is fighting against democracy (...) If he can attack Ukraine,
itheoretically it could be any other European country".[666][667]
i
iLithuania's foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said "The battle for
iUkraine is a battle for Europe. If Putin is not stopped there, he will go
ifurther."[668] President Emmanuel Macron of France said Putin was "deluding
ihimself".[669] French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian denounced him as "a
icynic and a dictator".[670] UK prime minister Boris Johnson also labelled
iPutin a "dictator" who had authorised "a tidal wave of violence against a
ifellow Slavic people".[671] Some authors, such as Michael Hirsh, described
iPutin as a "messianic" Russian nationalist and Eurasianist.[672][673][674]
i
iOn 31 December 2022, President Putin gave a New Year's address before a group
iof soldiers and other members of the Russian armed forces. Questions were
iraised about whether or not these were actual soldiers or actors. The BBC
iused
ifacial recognition to identify at least five of the people in the New Year's
iaddress as not servicemen but allies or employees of Putin's. A blonde woman
istanding behind Putin has been identified as Larisa Sergukhina, a member of
ithe United Russia party in the regional parliament for the Novgorod region.
iMs
iSergukina has appeared as a soldier, sailor and member of a church
icongregation in other past public appearances by President Putin.[675]
i
i===== Electoral history =====
i
i===== Personal life =====
i
iOn 28 July 1983, Putin married Lyudmila Shkrebneva, and they lived together
iin East Germany from 1985 to 1990. They have two daughters, Mariya Putina,
iborn on 28 April 1985 in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), and Yekaterina
iPutina, born on 31 August 1986 in Dresden, East Germany (now Germany).[676]
i
iAn investigation by Proekt published in November 2020 alleged that Putin has
ianother daughter, Elizaveta, also known as Luiza Rozova,[677] (born in March
i2003),[678] with Svetlana Krivonogikh.[4][679] In April 2008, the Moskovsky
iKorrespondent reported that Putin had divorced Lyudmila and was engaged to
imarry Olympic gold medalist Alina Kabaeva, a former rhythmic gymnast and
iRussian politician.[2] The story was denied,[2] and the newspaper was shut
idown shortly thereafter.[3] Putin and Lyudmila continued to make public
iappearances together as spouses,[680][681] while the status of his
irelationship with Kabaeva became a topic of speculation.[682]
i
iOn 6 June 2013, Putin and Lyudmila announced that their marriage was over; on
i1 April 2014, the Kremlin confirmed that the divorce had been
ifinalised.[683][684][685] Kabaeva reportedly gave birth to a daughter by
iPutin
iin 2015;[686][687] this report was denied.[686] Kabaeva reportedly gave birth
ito twin sons by Putin in 2019.[5][688] However, in 2022, Swiss media, citing
ithe couple's Swiss gynecologist, wrote that on both occasions Kabaeva gave
ibirth to a boy.[6]
i
iPutin has two grandsons, born in 2012 and 2017,[689][690] through Maria.[691]
iHe reportedly also has a granddaughter, born in 2017, through
iKaterina.[692][693] His cousin, Igor Putin, was a director at Moscow-based
iMaster Bank and was accused in a number of money-laundering
iscandals.[694][695]
i
iOfficial figures released during the legislative election of 2007 put Putin's
iwealth at approximately 3.7 million rubles (US$280,000) in bank accounts, a
iprivate 77.4-square-meter (833 sq ft) apartment in Saint Petersburg, and
imiscellaneous other assets.[696][697] Putin's reported 2006 income totaled 2
imillion rubles (approximately $152,000). In 2012, Putin reported an income of
i3.6 million rubles ($270,000).[698][699] Putin has been photographed wearing
ia
inumber of expensive wristwatches, collectively valued at $700,000, nearly six
itimes his annual salary.[700][701] Putin has been known on occasion to give
iwatches valued at thousands of dollars as gifts, for example a watch
iidentified as a Blancpain to a Siberian boy he met while on vacation in 2009,
iand another similar watch to a factory worker the same year.[702]
i
iAccording to Russian opposition politicians and journalists,[703][704] Putin
isecretly possesses a multi-billion-dollar fortune via successive ownership of
istakes in a number of Russian companies.[705][706] According to one editorial
iin The Washington Post, "Putin might not technically own these 43 aircraft,
ibut, as the sole political power in Russia, he can act like they're
ihis".[707]
iAn RIA Novosti journalist argued that "[Western] intelligence agencies ...
icould not find anything". These contradictory claims were analyzed by
iPolygraph.info,[708] which looked at a number of reports by Western (Anders
iÅslund estimate of $100–160 billion) and Russian (Stanislav Belkovsky
iestimated of $40 billion) analysts, CIA (estimate of $40 billion in 2007) as
iwell as counterarguments of Russian media. Polygraph concluded:
i
iThere is uncertainty on the precise sum of Putin's wealth, and the assessment
iby the Director of U.S. National Intelligence apparently is not yet complete.
iHowever, with the pile of evidence and documents in the Panama Papers and in
ithe hands of independent investigators such as those cited by Dawisha,
iPolygraph.info finds that Danilov's claim that Western intelligence agencies
ihave not been able to find evidence of Putin's wealth to be misleading
i
iIn April 2016, 11 million documents belonging to Panamanian law firm Mossack
iFonseca were leaked to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and the
iWashington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The
iname of Putin does not appear in any of the records, and Putin denied his
iinvolvement with the company.[709] However, various media have reported on
ithree of Putin's associates on the list.[710] According to the Panama Papers
ileak, close trusted associates of Putin own offshore companies worth US$2
ibillion in total.[711] The German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung regards the
ipossibility of Putin's family profiting from this money as
iplausible.[712][713]
i
iAccording to the paper, the US$2 billion had been "secretly shuffled through
ibanks and shadow companies linked to Putin's associates", such as
iconstruction
ibillionaires Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, and Bank Rossiya, previously
iidentified by the U.S. State Department as being treated by Putin as his
ipersonal bank account, had been central in facilitating this. It concludes
ithat "Putin has shown he is willing to take aggressive steps to maintain
isecrecy and protect [such] communal assets."[714][715]
i
iA significant proportion of the money trail leads to Putin's best friend
iSergei Roldugin. Although a musician, and in his own words, not a
ibusinessman,
iit appears he has accumulated assets valued at $100m, and possibly more. It
ihas been suggested he was picked for the role because of his low
iprofile.[710]
iThere have been speculations that Putin, in fact, owns the funds,[716] and
iRoldugin just acted as a proxy.[717] Garry Kasparov said that "[Putin]
icontrols enough money, probably more than any other individual in the history
iof human race".[718]
i
iAs president and prime minister, Putin has lived in numerous official
iresidences throughout the country.[719] These residences include: the Moscow
iKremlin, Novo-Ogaryovo in Moscow Oblast, Gorki-9 [ru] near Moscow, Bocharov
iRuchey in Sochi, Dolgiye Borody (residence) in Novgorod Oblast, and Riviera

iSochi.[720] In August 2012, critics of Putin listed the ownership of 20
ivillas
iand palaces, nine of which were built during Putin's 12 years in power.[721]
i
iSoon after Putin returned from his KGB service in Dresden, East Germany, he
ibuilt a dacha in Solovyovka on the eastern shore of Lake Komsomolskoye on the
iKarelian Isthmus in Priozersky District of Leningrad Oblast, near St.
iPetersburg. After the dacha burned down in 1996, Putin built a new one
iidentical to the original and was joined by a group of seven friends who
ibuilt
idachas nearby. In 1996, the group formally registered their fraternity as a
ico-operative society, calling it Ozero ("Lake") and turning it into a gated
icommunity.[722]
i
iA massive Italianate-style mansion costing an alleged US$1 billion[723] and
idubbed "Putin's Palace" is under construction near the Black Sea village of
iPraskoveevka. In 2012, Sergei Kolesnikov, a former business associate of
iPutin's, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that he had been ordered by
iDeputy
iPrime Minister Igor Sechin to oversee the building of the palace.[724] He
ialso
isaid that the mansion, built on government land and sporting three helipads,
iplus a private road paid for from state funds and guarded by officials
iwearing
iuniforms of the official Kremlin guard service, have been built for Putin's
iprivate use.[725]
i
iOn 19 January 2021, two days after Alexei Navalny was detained by Russian
iauthorities upon his return to Russia, a video investigation by him and the
iAnti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) was published accusing Putin of using
ifraudulently obtained funds to build the estate for himself in what he called
i"the world's biggest bribe." In the investigation, Navalny said that the
iestate is 39 times the size of Monaco and cost over 100 billion rubles ($1.35
ibillion) to construct. It also showed aerial footage of the estate via a
idrone
iand a detailed floorplan of the palace that Navalny said was given by a
icontractor, which he compared to photographs from inside the palace that were
ileaked onto the Internet in 2011. He also detailed an elaborate corruption
ischeme allegedly involving Putin's inner circle that allowed Putin to hide
ibillions of dollars to build the estate.[726][727][728]

iex-wife Lyudmila after their divorce.[730]

iPutin is Russian Orthodox. His mother was a devoted Christian believer who
iattended the Russian Orthodox Church, while his father was an atheist.[731]
iThough his mother kept no icons at home, she attended church regularly,
idespite government persecution of her religion at that time. His mother
isecretly baptized him as a baby, and she regularly took him to services.[32]
i
iAccording to Putin, his religious awakening began after a serious car crash
iinvolving his wife in 1993, and a life-threatening fire that burned down
itheir
idacha in August 1996.[731] Shortly before an official visit to Israel,
iPutin's
imother gave him his baptismal cross, telling him to get it blessed. Putin
istates, "I did as she said and then put the cross around my neck. I have
inever
itaken it off since."[32]
i
iWhen asked in 2007 whether he believes in God, he responded: "There are
ithings I believe, which should not in my position, at least, be shared with
ithe public at large for everybody's consumption because that would look like
iself-advertising or a political striptease."[732] Putin's rumoured confessor
iis Russian Orthodox Bishop Tikhon Shevkunov.[733] The sincerity of his
iChristianity has been rejected by his former advisor Sergei Pugachev.[734]
i
iPutin watches football and supports FC Zenit Saint Petersburg.[735] He also
idisplays an interest in ice hockey and bandy,[736] and played in a
istar-studded hockey game on his 63rd birthday.[737]

iswitching to sambo at the age of fourteen.[739] He won competitions in both
isports in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). He was awarded eighth dan of the

i(2000),[i] and Judo: History, Theory, Practice in English (2004).[742]
iBenjamin Wittes, a black belt in taekwondo and aikido and editor of Lawfare,
ihas disputed Putin's martial arts skills, stating that there is no video
ievidence of Putin displaying any real noteworthy judo skills.[743][744]
i
iIn March 2022, Putin was removed from all positions in the International Judo
iFederation (IJF) due to the Russian war in Ukraine.[745]
i
iIn July 2022, the director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, William
iBurns, stated they had no evidence to suggest Putin was unstable or in bad
ihealth. The statement was made because of increasing unconfirmed media
ispeculation about Putin's health. Burns had previously been U.S. Ambassador
ito
iRussia, and had personally observed Putin for over two decades, including a
ipersonal meeting in November 2021. A Kremlin spokesperson also dismissed
irumours of Putin's bad health as fake.[746]

iThe Russian political magazine Sobesednik [ru] alleged in 2018 that Putin had
ia sensory room installed in his private residence in the Novgorod
iOblast.[747]

iThe White House, as well as Western generals, politicians, and political
ianalysts, have questioned Putin's mental health after two years of isolation
iduring the COVID-19 pandemic.[748][749][750]
i
iIn April 2022 tabloid newspaper The Sun reported, based on video footage,
ithat Putin may have Parkinson's disease.[751][752][753] This speculation,
iwhich has not been supported by medical professionals, has spread in part due
ito Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which many saw as an irrational act.[753]
iThe
iKremlin[751] rejected the possibility of Parkinson's along with outside
imedical professionals, who stress that it is impossible to diagnose the
icondition based on video clips alone.[753]
