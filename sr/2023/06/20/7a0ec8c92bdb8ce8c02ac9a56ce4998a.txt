iSpin: The trade will be finalized in the coming days, so the exact details of
ithe deal remain unclear. Washington's new ownership knocks down the first
idomino in completely rebuilding its roster, while the Suns get a third star

ipair with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker. Beal has scored at least 20 points
iper game in seven consecutive campaigns and posted 50/36/84 shooting splits
