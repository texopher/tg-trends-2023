i
iThe United States are on top of CONCACAF again.
i
iAfter humbling a slumping Mexico side in the semifinals, they dominated a
irising Canada squad in the title match, defending their CONCACAF Nations
iLeague title and winning the trophy again.
i
iWith the young competition in just its second iteration, the United States
iare the only nation to have won the tournament, having triumphed in 2021 and
iagain this time around.
i
iGio Reyna was the star of the first half, pulling the strings and creating
iboth goals from Chris Richards and Folarin Balogun. Both goal scorers bagged
itheir first national team goals, the first two players to do so in finals in
iU.S. history.
i
iWith the 2023 Gold Cup just a week away and Gregg Berhalter set to return as
iU.S. national team head coach shortly after, the USMNT is primed for a big
isummer, and the 2026 World Cup cycle starts with a bang.
i

i
i===== USA dominate top CONCACAF rivals Mexico, Canada =====
i
iThe United States finished third in 2022 World Cup qualifying behind their
itwo continental rivals Mexico and Canada, but that seems to have been a false
inegative.
i
iSince, the U.S. were the only CONCACAF side to reach the World Cup knockout
istage, and then utterly dominated their two border rivals in the Nations
iLeague over the past week. Knock the competition at your own risk, as both
iMexico and Canada deployed a full-strength lineup, and both nations were
iwell-beaten.
i
iMexico were utterly overwhelmed, and had no answer for the USA's technical
iability and tactical setup, resorting to kicking and thrashing the U.S.
iphysically out of frustration. Canada, meanwhile, were unable to get Alphonso
iDavies and Jonathan David on the ball in dangerous areas, completely taken
iout
iof the game.
i
iThe USMNT just dismantled Mexico then Canada w/ out Tyler Adams, Weston
iMckennie, Miles Robinson, & Sergi√±o Dest.. Oh, and a/ an interim to the
iinterim coach. THE KINGS OF CONCACAF üëë
i
i===== Balogun, Reyna provide future promise, upend USMNT hierarchy =====
i
iThe arrival of 21-year-old Folarin Balogun and 20-year-old Gio Reyna has
igiven the U.S. attack a much-needed shot of adrenaline, but it's also going
ito
igive Gregg Berhalter a headache as the team advances towards the 2026 World
iCup.
i
iShould the "MMA" midfield trio of Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie, and Yunus
iMusah all be healthy, Berhalter may have to leave one out for Gio Reyna, who
iwas utterly brilliant across the two games in a deep No. 8 position. Balogun,
imeanwhile, seems the clear starter at striker, a position where few U.S.
iinternationals have impressed over the past few years, but a position where
iyoung Ricardo Pepi is also rising to prominence.
i
iThere could be some big lineup decisions for Berhalter to make down the road,
ibut surely he will tackle those when they come, as injuries and club form
icould also be a factor in future selection choices.
i
iThe USMNT won its 9th championship in a major competition (7 Gold Cup, 2
iConcacaf Nations League). 21-year-old Folarin Balogun became the 2nd-youngest
iU.S. player to score in a final over the last 35 years (Giovanni Reyna - 18).

i
i===== Canada not quite ready to lead CONCACAF =====
i
iCanada have risen to CONCACAF prominence with lightning speed over the past
itwo years under John Herdman, there's no question. Their ability to top the
iWorld Cup qualifying standings proved they can perform over the long term and
igive the top nations fits.
i
iStill, it doesn't quite appear they are ready to take the next step and be
ithe best in the continent. They played well at the World Cup but didn't take
itheir chances, and ended up without a point as they were dumped out of the
igroup stage in Qatar. Now, they were well beaten by the U.S. in a game where
ithey tried a bunch of things, and none of them worked.
i
iCanada still don't quite have the talent depth to overcome either individual
istruggles or opponents keying on main players. Critical midfielder Stephen
iEustaquio had a poor game against the United States, and Alphonso Davies was
idouble-teamed on the flank. With these two taken out of the game, the rest of
ithe squad didn't have the talent across the rest of the field to make up the
idifference.
i
iThere's no question that this side has very talented players and good role
iplayers, but they're not deep enough yet to be considered the best in North &
iCentral America.
i
iFrustrated with Alphonso Davies tonight. Poor passing, not linking up with
iwide open teammates and shots from range landing on Mars. Trying to do it all
ihimself again. #CANMNT
i
i===== USA vs Canada live updates, highlights, commentary =====
i
iThe United States wins their second consecutive CONCACAF Nations League
ititle! For the first time ever, the U.S. wins three continental titles in a
irow, with the 2021 Gold Cup sandwiched between the two Nations League
itrophies.
i
iGio Reyna was the star of both the semifinal and the final, and Folarin
iBalogun gets his debut goal. It's very exciting times for U.S. fans who are
itreated to a brilliant and young core of the international squad.

i
i90+4 min: Jonathan David delivers a wonderful cross right on the goal mouth
iwith the U.S. defense lagging behind, but there's nobody there to meet it and
ithe chance goes begging. It may be their last opportunity to get a goal.
i
i89th min: Christian Pulisic goes down injured. He looks to have pulled
isomething, maybe a hamstring, stretching for a ball down the left touchline.
iHe stays on for now. John Herdman makes his final change, bringing Junior
iHoilett on for Stephen Eustaquio.
i
i87th min: Christian Pulisic tries to break down the left, realizes he has no
ihelp, and cuts it back, before being bulldozed by Tajon Buchanan to win a
ifree-kick. The U.S. can kill precious seconds off the clock.
i
iUS fans chanting ‚Äústick to hockey‚Äù to the Canada fans üòÇ
i
i84th min: Canada are holding all the attacking possession in the final few
iminutes as they search for a goal. They come close with a lateral cut-back in
ithe penalty area, but Antonee Robinson is there again to snatch it and clear.
i
i80th min: Christian Pulisic is livid that a foul wasn't called as Ricardo
iPepi fought for the ball going forward, and he instead is whistled for a foul
ion Richie Laryea. Johnny Cardoso is booked for booting the ball away. A
iminute
ilater, Matt Turner is also carded for time wasting.
i
i75th min: Alphonso Davies is fouled by Joe Scally on the flank, and Scally is
idown with what appears to be a cramp. Canada are again trying to get him off
ithe field quicker, but he's not having it.
i
iFolarin Balogun is withdrawn, replaced by Ricardo Pepi. Canada respond with a
isubstitution of their own, as Lucas Cavallini replaces Cyle Larin. Minutes
ilater, BJ Callaghan makes another sub, as Auston Trusty comes on for Joe
iScally.
i
i73rd min: Chance, USA! Somehow, some way, Folarin Balogun and Christian
iPulisic come oh so close to scoring a third for the U.S. It seemed about four
itimes during that build forward that the chance would evaporate, but those
itwo
istill manage to keep it alive until Pulisic just can't quite get on the end
iof
ithe vertical ball, and Sam Adekugbe pokes it away at the last moment.
i
i68th min: Johnny Cardoso is brought on for Brenden Aaronson. Canada are very
iunhappy with how slowly Brenden is walking off the pitch, and Tajon Buchanan
igives him a really aggressive push. Aaronson does not react, but his U.S.
iteammates are not pleased, and a small scuffle ensues, with captain Christian
iPulisic right in Buchanan's face. This U.S. team seems to have learned from
ithe Mexico semifinal. Buchanan is lucky not to be booked for his initial act.
i
iTajon Buchanan trying to take revenge on Brendan Aaronson for the 14 times
ithe Revs lost to the Union in 2020
i
i67th min: Chance, Canada! Cyle Larin comes up empty twice! He gets a great
icutback from Sam Adekugbe in acres of spaces but delivers a poor low effort
ithat's blocked, and then on the follow-up he blasts it over. That's poor from
iCanada's all-time leading scorer.

i
i66th min: Luca de la Torre goes to ground studs up and catches Jonathan David
iin the shins. He probably should be booked for that, but it goes unpunished.
i
i60th min: Alphonso Davies beats Joe Scally near the end line to feed a
ivicious cross onto the doorstep, but there's nobody crashing to meet it, and
iAntonee Robinson clears. A very dangerous moment goes begging.
i
iCanada makes a triple substitution, taking off Alistair Johnston, Scott
iKennedy, and Jonathan Osorio, bringing on Steven Vitoria, Sam Adekugbe, and
iTajon Buchanan.
i
i56th min: Chance, USA! HOW DID THE U.S. not score?!?! Chris Richards, looking
ifor a shocking brace, forces Milan Borjan into a sensational save, touching
ihis effort off the crossbar. The ensuing corner sees the U.S. come close
iagain, as Balogun's shot is blocked off the line by Scott Kennedy. Balogun
iprobably should have scored there, but his effort had beaten Borjan, so
ithere's not much else he can do.

i
i54th min: Chance, USA! Folarin Balogun forces a save from Milan Borjan, after
ibeing fed through by Antonee Robinson down the left. The U.S. continues to
icook, and Canada have very few answers. Tim Weah takes a long-distance hit on
ithe corner, and it's got a ton of venom, but can't quite get through the
itrees.
i
i53rd min: Alphonso Davies lets a shot fly from a tight angle to the left, one
ithat had very little chance of success, blazing it miles over the bar. It's a
imoment of frustration for the Canada playmaker, who has been very quiet this
imatch.
i
iKickoff: The second half is under way, and unfortunately, Gio Reyna is not
iamongst the U.S. squad on the field. He's been replaced by Luca de la Torre,
iwhich is an indication that Reyna may be hurt. He was spectacular in the
ifirst
ihalf, but got hurt near the end of play, and limped into the locker room.
iThat's a shame, because the U.S. will need him moving forward. Reyna has had
iinjury issues in his career, and U.S. Soccer announced that he has a calf
iinjury.
i
iNo changes for Canada, which is a bit of a surprise given how poorly they
iplayed in the first half. It wouldn't have been shocking to see tScott
iKennedy
iwithdrawn ‚Äî he has been carded, and was beat on Folarin Balogun's goal.
i
iüá∫üá∏ Gio Reyna had 31 touches in the first half, third-most on the USMNT
ibehind Zimmerman and Scally (33 each). üá∫üá∏ Reyna also led the team with

ichances created. pic.twitter.com/guvFqodZ3I
i
iThe first half ends with another glorious set-piece for the U.S. with
iChristian Pulisic feeding Gio Reyna at the far post, whose header nearly ends
iup on the doorstep for Folarin Balogun, but he just can't cap off the
iscramble.
i
iThe United States absolutely dominated the first 45 minutes, and have a 2-0
ilead to show for it. Chris Richards opened the scoring, and Folarin Balogun
iadded a second. Both players become the first two in U.S. history to score
itheir first-ever international goal in a final.

iThe USMNT has won 50 consecutive games when leading by two goals, dating back
ito 2014. There is an issue for Gio Reyna, who will need to prove fit, or he
icould be replaced by Luca de la Torre after the break.

i
i45+4 min: Christian Pulisic takes a kick on the calf from Richie Laryea, and
ithe Canadian defender gets a yellow card for his effort.
i
i45th min: The U.S. players are frustrating Canadian midfielders, and Canadian
iplayers are resorting to fouls. Gio Reyna is pushed by Stephen Eustaquio
iright
iinto Alistair Johnston, and then Folarin Balogun is held back in midfield to
idraw the whistle. Reyna looks to be in some pain, and the training staff
icomes
iout to work on his ankle.
i
iReyna gets up and returns to play, but he is sporting a pretty significant
ilimp.
i
i42nd min: Chance, USA! Gio Reyna is a man possessed. He skins three Canadian
idefenders by dribbling out of his own half, and he feeds Christian Pulisic
iwho
iis felled and earns a dangerous free-kick.

iThe tekkers in this game, I truly can't. Everyone is showing out like Canada
iis nothing.
i
i39th min: Chance, Canada! Matt Turner makes another good save! This time the
ieffort comes from a tight angle to the left, and he's needed to make another
istop before the return effort is blocked by Antonee Robinson. Canada are
ibuilding into this match now, and threatening the U.S. back line.
i
i37th min: Chance, Canada! Matt Turner makes a good save off Stephen Eustaquio
iwho makes a final-third tackle and snatches the ball away. He stumbles on the
itackle, but gets up and has a hit. Ultimately, it's a relatively tame effort,
iand Turner is up to the task.
i
i34th min: GOAL! USA! Folarin Balogun has his first U.S. goal, and it's Gio
iReyna who assists again! Reyna drives right past Stephen Eustaquio, and
islides
ia perfect vertical ball for Balogun streaking by Scott Kennedy on goal.
iBalogun, who slid right around the outside shoulder of Kennedy, finishes with

i
i28th min: Chance, USA! Folarin Balogun has a big chance at the top of the
i18-yard box, but as he tried to chest the ball down, the ball pops up in the
iair instead of down to his feet, and under heavy pressure from Scott Kennedy,
ithe striker can't get his header on target. Balogun took a pretty heavy shot
ifrom Kennedy on the attempt, and is down needing treatment. The staff appears
ito be doing a concussion test.
i
i27th minute So close! pic.twitter.com/k6DI9ReF9p
i
i23rd min: Many journalists and fans have noticed that one potential reason
ifor Brenden Aaronson's presence in the U.S. lineup is to give Joe Scally help
iwith Alphonso Davies. Every time Davies receives the ball, Aaronson is right
iin his face. Aaronson is a pressing wizard from the Red Bull developmental
isystem, and he's so far doing a great job. Davies has 24 touches so far, but
ito very little effect.
i
iCanada appears to have responded by switching Davies to the right wing.
i
i#usmnt definitely trying to protect Scally. Almost every time Davies gets the
iball, Aaronson is the first to apply pressure.
i
i15th min: Scott Kennedy, who came into the starting lineup in place of Steven
iVitoria, picks up an early yellow card for a late tackle that sends Gio Reyna
iflying in midfield.
i
i12th min: GOAL! USA! Chris Richards rises high like a salmon to meet a
icorner, and bags his first international goal! Gio Reyna's delivery goes
iright
ito the top of the six-yard box, and with Folarin Balogun screening a
idefender,
iRichards meets it and drives the ball into the ground. With Milan Borjan
isliding across the goal left to right, the ball goes behind his movement and
ihe can't turn his body in time.
i
iIt's the first goal off a corner for the United States in a whopping 13
igames, dating back to the 2022 Gold Cup. Additionally, it's Richards' first
igoal for the U.S. national team on just his third-ever shot attempt!

i
i11th min: Tim Weah deep down the right feeds a driven lateral cross along the
iend line to Folarin Balogun at the near post, but the ball gets stuck at his
ifeet and he can't turn it goalward.
i
i9th min: Canada do what they do best and counter well, with pace down the
iright through Ismael Kone. He feeds Jonathan David who takes a shot, but from
ia relatively tight angle and marshaled to the outside, his hit is right at
iMatt Turner. A warning shot for the U.S. defense to keep in mind. Kone is a
ireally bright young player.
i
i8th min: Chance, USA! With a third recycle after a corner, Walker Zimmerman
iout of nowhere has a hit on goal, and it's not far away! He rips it from
ioutside the penalty area, and while that's not exactly a place you want a
icenter-back shooting, he nearly makes it worth the risk!
i
i3rd min: The U.S. has the first good attacking move, with Gio Reyna and Tim
iWeah combining down the right side of the 18-yard box. Reyna takes a
itight-angle shot, but it's held easily by Milan Borjan, who could be making
ione of his final Canada appearances.
i
iCMNT: Look like Milan Borjan had watering eyes during the national anthem. At
i35-yeards-old and leaving Red Star for next season, this might be one of his
ilast matches with Canada too. Emotional night for this Canadian men's
inational
iteam. #CanMNT
i
iOh, and Gio Reyna is not wearing the mask. He's not the first player to hate
iplaying with it on. Heung Min-Son talked repeatedly about how he couldn't see
iwith it on.
i
iKickoff: They're under way in Las Vegas! The final of the CONCACAF Nations
iLeague is now in play, and a confederation trophy is on the line. Can the
iU.S.
iwin the second Nations League title in two years, and remain the only team to
iwin the new competition, or will Canada follow up its No. 1 spot in World Cup
iqualifying with its first trophy in over two decades?

i45 mins to kick: It's all final in the third-place match as Mexico top Panama
i1-0, but it wasn't the overwhelming turnaround that Diego Cocca would have

inone of them have been especially promising, and he's under intense pressure
ifrom El Tri fans for his style of play, lineup selections, and general
itactical approach.
i
iIt's unlikely that Mexico would fire Cocca with the Gold Cup right around the
icorner, but after that tournament, there will surely be an inquest into how
ithe team has underperformed during his short tenure, and if a change is
ineeded.
i
iIf it's any indication of how the Mexican team is perceived at the moment,
ithe crowd was incredibly sparse for the first of tonight's double-header.

i
i55 mins to kick: There's a bit of a contentious lineup selection for the
iUnited States, as BJ Callaghan has gone all-out with attacking players,
iputting Brenden Aaronson into midfield over the option of Luca de la Torre.
iWith Weston McKennie suspended and Tyler Adams injured, it seemed like de la
iTorre would be the natural choice to slide in.
i
iAgainst a Canada side that loves to counter-attack, there could be gaps in
ithe U.S. midfield without a truly defensive-minded player in the trio. We'll
isee if Callaghan comes to regret that move at the end of the match.
i
iAaronson over de la Torre is a bad choice.
i
iI guess it's an overall good thing I'm bummed a La Liga starter isn't playing
iover a Premier League starter?
i
i1 hour, 10 mins to kick: The lineups are in, and the United States have
ideployed an exceptionally attacking lineup, hoping to follow up the 3-0 win
iover Mexico by swarming Canada as well. Folarin Balogun again starts up
ifront,
iand he is supported by Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna, Brenden Aaronson, and
iTim
iWeah.
i
iTo counter, Canada have Alphonso Davies available from the start, after he
icame off the bench against Panama, and he will go up against Joe Scally, who
iis in place of the suspended Sergino Dest.
i
i1 hour, 32 mins to kick: The U.S. national team Twitter account released a
ireally cool ‚Äî and very rare ‚Äî behind-the-scenes video from the win over
iMexico
ion Thursday. There's some really fun content in this nine-minute video, but
ithere are some newsworthy moments as well.
i
iMost notably, the video includes Weston McKennie apologizing to the team for
ihis red card against Mexico which left him suspended, and then pumping them
iup
iwith words of encouragement that highlight the team's depth. McKennie's
iexplitive-laden apology read, "This whole f‚Äî‚Äî team that‚Äôs in here, that‚Äôs
iwhat
if‚Äî‚Äî matters. And I have complete faith in every single last one of you f‚Äî‚Äî
iplayers that we‚Äôre going to lift another trophy come the 18th." The team
iapplauded McKennie after his short speech.
i
iBJ Callaghan said in his post-match press conference that he was proud of
iMcKennie and Sergino Dest despite their red cards, and he echoed that in his
ilocker room speech, saying "I know that it comes from a good place, from
isticking up for each other."
i
iAlso of note from the video is Christian Pulisic's brief words before the
iMexico match, where he claims "we're not the underdogs." Which, to be fair,
iwas true. They're certainly not the underdogs here tonight either.

i
i1 hour, 45 mins to kick: While Tyler Adams will surely have reason to
idisagree, it's not an absolutely wild assertion that Stephen Eustaquio is the
ibest midfielder in CONCACAF. The Porto man has risen prominently over the
ipast
i12 months, and while he might not be his country's "best" player, with
iAlphonso Davies and Jonathan David still with reason to that badge, Eustaquio
ihas certainly become Canada's most influential player.

iof debate in among the USMNT fan base, but Berhalter will not lead the team
ihere or at the upcoming Gold Cup.
i
iU.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker preferred to hold Berhalter back
iin favor of developing a long-term plan, but Berhalter is yet again the
iteam's
ipatriarch, and his influence will be felt from this point on.

i===== USA vs Canada lineups, team news =====
i
iFor their red cards in the chaotic semifinal, Weston McKennie and Sergino
iDest will play no part in tonight's final, suspended after their early
idepartures. Those are big losses for the USMNT, especially McKennie who has
ibeen essential to the U.S. midfield. Aside from replacing those two, with
iBrenden Aaronson and Joe Scally entering, BJ Callaghan made just one other
ichange.
i
iWalker Zimmerman enters in place of Miles Robinson, who is reportedly
iinjured, yet listed amongst the substitutes. Robinson's availability for the
imatch is unknown.
i
iRicardo Pepi could maybe have been rewarded for his goal against Mexico with
ia start up front, but it's new commit Folarin Balogun who yet again gets the
istart. Balogun did contribute in his debut cap, and it would have been a
iharsh
idecision to sit the Arsenal youngster.
i
iUSA confirmed starting lineup (4-3-3): Matt Turner (GK) ‚Äî Joe Scally, Chris
iRichards, Walker Zimmerman, Antonee Robinson ‚Äî Luca de la Torre, Yunus Musah,
iGio Reyna ‚Äî Timothy Weah, Folarin Balogun, Christian Pulisic.
i
iUSA subs (10): Callender (GK), S. Johnson (GK), M. Robinson, Trusty, Cardoso,
ide la Torre, Sonora, Booth, Zendejas, Pepi.

i
iManager John Herdman has been known to chop and change his lineup and
iformation from game to game, making it extremely difficult to predict how
iCanada will play. The biggest question was the status of Alphonso Davies, who
imissed the final six Bundesliga matches of the season with a hamstring
iinjury,
ibut after he came off the bench against Panama in the semifinal, he starts
ihere in the final.
i
iHerdman has chosen to change out a center-back, with Scott Kennedy entering
ifor Steven Vitoria, and Jonathan Osorio enters in place of Tajon Buchanan.
i
iCanada confirmed starting lineup (3-5-2): Milan Borjan (GK) ‚Äî Alistair
iJohnston, Kamal Miller, Scott Kennedy ‚Äî Richie Laryea, Ismael Kone, Stephen
iEustaquio, Jonathan Osorio, Alphonso Davies ‚Äî Jonathan David, Cyle Larin.
i
iCanada subs (12): St. Clair (GK), McGill (GK), Adekugbe, Vitoria, Zator,
iBombito, Wotherspoon, Loturi, Hutchinson, Hoilett, Buchanan, Cavallini.

i===== USA vs Canada betting odds, lines =====
i
iThe United States are heavy favorites, even with their pair of suspensions to
iWeston McKennie and Sergino Dest.
i
iHowever, the U.S. will be wary of their opponent in this final. The two have
inot met since World Cup qualifying last year, with Canada achieving a result
iin both meetings ‚Äî first a draw in the United States in September of 2021,
ifollowed by a 2-0 victory at home in late January of 2022.
i
iIn fact, Canada has earned either a draw or a win in five of the last seven
imeetings between these two teams across all competitions, dating back to a
ipair of friendlies in 2012 and 2013.
