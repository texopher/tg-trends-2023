iin Europe (green and dark grey)
i
iSwitzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a landlocked country
ilocated at the confluence of Western, Central and Southern Europe.[e][13] It
iis bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north
iand Austria and Liechtenstein to the east.
i
iSwitzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and
ithe Jura; the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, whereas most of
ithe country's population of 8.7 million are concentrated on the plateau,
iwhich
ihosts the largest cities and economic centres, including Zürich, Geneva and
iBasel.
i
iSwitzerland originates from the Old Swiss Confederacy established in the Late
iMiddle Ages, following a series of military successes against Austria and
iBurgundy; the Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the country's founding
idocument. Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally
irecognised in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Switzerland has maintained a
ipolicy of armed neutrality since the 16th century and has not fought an
iinternational war since 1815. It joined the United Nations only in 2002, but
ipursues an active foreign policy that include frequent involvement in
ipeace-building processes worldwide.[14]
i
iSwitzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross, one of the world's oldest and
iwell-known humanitarian organisations, and hosts the headquarters or offices
iof most major international institutions, including the WTO, the WHO, the
iILO,
iFIFA, and the United Nations. It is a founding member of the European Free
iTrade Association (EFTA), but not part of the European Union (EU), the
iEuropean Economic Area, or the Eurozone; however, it participates in the
iEuropean single market and the Schengen Area through bilateral treaties.
iSwitzerland is a federal republic composed of 26 cantons, with federal
iauthorities based in Bern.[a][2][1]
i
iIt has four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and
iRomansh. Although most Swiss are German-speaking, national identity is fairly
icohesive, being rooted in a common historical background, shared values such
ias federalism and direct democracy,[15][page needed] and Alpine
isymbolism.[16][17] Swiss identity transcends language, ethnicity, and
ireligion, leading to Switzerland being described as a Willensnation ("nation
iof volition") rather than a nation state.[18]
i
iDue to its linguistic diversity, Switzerland is known by multiple native
inames: Schweiz [ˈʃvaɪts] (German);[f][g] Suisse [sɥis(ə)] audio (help·info)
i(French); Svizzeracode: ita promoted to code: it [ˈzvittsera] (Italian); and
iSvizracode: roh promoted to code: rm [ˈʒviːtsrɐ, ˈʒviːtsʁɐ] (Romansh).[h] On
icoins and stamps, the Latin name, Confoederatio Helveticacode: lat promoted
ito
icode: la — frequently shortened to "Helvetia" — is used instead of the spoken
ilanguages.
i
iSwitzerland is one of the world's most developed countries. It has the
ihighest nominal wealth per adult[19] and the eighth-highest gross domestic
iproduct (GDP) per capita.[20][21] Switzerland ranks first in the Human
iDevelopment Index since 2021 and performs highly also on several
iinternational
imetrics, including economic competitiveness and democratic governance. Cities
isuch as Zürich, Geneva and Basel rank among the highest in terms of quality
iof
ilife,[22][23] albeit with some of the highest costs of living.[24]
i
i===== Etymology =====
i
iThe English name Switzerland is a portmanteau of Switzer, an obsolete term
ifor a Swiss person which was in use during the 16th to 19th centuries, and
iland.[25] The English adjective Swiss is a loanword from French Suisse, also
iin use since the 16th century. The name Switzer is from the Alemannic
iSchwiizer, in origin an inhabitant of Schwyz and its associated territory,
ione
iof the Waldstätte cantons which formed the nucleus of the Old Swiss
iConfederacy. The Swiss began to adopt the name for themselves after the
iSwabian War of 1499, used alongside the term for "Confederates", Eidgenossen
i(literally: comrades by oath), used since the 14th century. The data code for
iSwitzerland, CH, is derived from Latin Confoederatio Helveticacode: lat
ipromoted to code: la (English: Helvetic Confederation).
i
iThe toponym Schwyz itself was first attested in 972, as Old High German
iSuittes, perhaps related to swedan 'to burn' (cf. Old Norse svíða 'to singe,
iburn'), referring to the area of forest that was burned and cleared to
ibuild.[26] The name was extended to the area dominated by the canton, and
iafter the Swabian War of 1499 gradually came to be used for the entire
iConfederation.[27][28] The Swiss German name of the country, Schwiiz, is
ihomophonous to that of the canton and the settlement, but distinguished by
ithe
iuse of the definite article (d'Schwiiz for the Confederation,[29] but simply
iSchwyz for the canton and the town).[30] The long [iː] of Swiss German is
ihistorically and still often today spelled ⟨y⟩ rather than ⟨ii⟩, preserving
ithe original identity of the two names even in writing.
i
iThe Latin name Confoederatio Helveticacode: lat promoted to code: la was
ineologised and introduced gradually after the formation of the federal state
iin 1848, harking back to the Napoleonic Helvetic Republic. It appeared on
icoins from 1879, inscribed on the Federal Palace in 1902 and after 1948 used
iin the official seal[31] (e.g., the ISO banking code "CHF" for the Swiss
ifranc, and the country top-level domain ".ch", are both taken from the
istate's
iLatin name). Helveticacode: lat promoted to code: la is derived from the
iHelvetii, a Gaulish tribe living on the Swiss Plateau before the Roman era.
i
iHelvetia appeared as a national personification of the Swiss confederacy in
ithe 17th century in a 1672 play by Johann Caspar Weissenbach.[32]
i
i===== History =====
i
iThe state of Switzerland took its present form with the adoption of the Swiss
iFederal Constitution in 1848. Switzerland's precursors established a
idefensive
ialliance in 1291, forming a loose confederation that persisted for centuries.
i
iThe oldest traces of hominid existence in Switzerland date to about 150,000
iyears ago.[33] The oldest known farming settlements in Switzerland, which
iwere
ifound at Gächlingen, date to around 5300 BC.[33]
i
iThe earliest known tribes formed the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures, named
iafter the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of Lake Neuchâtel.
iLa Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age from around
i450 BC,[33] possibly influenced by Greek and Etruscan civilisations. One of
ithe most important tribal groups was the Helvetii. Steadily harassed by
iGermanic tribes, in 58 BC, the Helvetii decided to abandon the Swiss Plateau
iand migrate to western Gallia. Julius Caesar's armies pursued and defeated
ithem at the Battle of Bibracte, in today's eastern France, forcing the tribe
ito move back to its homeland.[33] In 15 BC, Tiberius (later the second Roman
iemperor) and his brother Drusus conquered the Alps, integrating them into the
iRoman Empire. The area occupied by the Helvetii first became part of Rome's
iGallia Belgica province and then of its Germania Superior province. The
ieastern portion of modern Switzerland was integrated into the Roman province
iof Raetia. Sometime around the start of the Common Era, the Romans maintained
ia large camp called Vindonissa, now a ruin at the confluence of the Aare and
iReuss rivers, near the town of Windisch.[35]
i
iThe first and second century AD was an age of prosperity on the Swiss
iPlateau. Towns such as Aventicum, Iulia Equestris and Augusta Raurica,
ireached
ia remarkable size, while hundreds of agricultural estates (Villae rusticae)
iwere established in the countryside.[citation needed]
i
iAround 260 AD, the fall of the Agri Decumates territory north of the Rhine
itransformed today's Switzerland into a frontier land of the Empire. Repeated
iraids by the Alamanni tribes provoked the ruin of the Roman towns and
ieconomy,
iforcing the population to shelter near Roman fortresses, like the Castrum
iRauracense near Augusta Raurica. The Empire built another line of defence at
ithe north border (the so-called Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes). At the end of the
ifourth century, the increased Germanic pressure forced the Romans to abandon
ithe linear defence concept. The Swiss Plateau was finally open to Germanic
itribes.[citation needed]
i
iIn the Early Middle Ages, from the end of the fourth century, the western
iextent of modern-day Switzerland was part of the territory of the Kings of
ithe
iBurgundians. The Alemanni settled the Swiss Plateau in the fifth century and
ithe valleys of the Alps in the eighth century, forming Alemannia. Modern-day
iSwitzerland was then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and
iBurgundy.[33] The entire region became part of the expanding Frankish Empire
iin the sixth century, following Clovis I's victory over the Alemanni at
iTolbiac in 504 AD, and later Frankish domination of the Burgundians.[36][37]
i
iThroughout the rest of the sixth, seventh and eighth centuries, Swiss regions
icontinued under Frankish hegemony (Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties) but
iafter its extension under Charlemagne, the Frankish Empire was divided by the
iTreaty of Verdun in 843.[33] The territories of present-day Switzerland
ibecame
idivided into Middle Francia and East Francia until they were reunified under
ithe Holy Roman Empire around 1000 AD.[33]
i
iBy 1200, the Swiss Plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of Savoy,
iZähringer, Habsburg, and Kyburg.[33] Some regions (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden,
ilater known as Waldstätten) were accorded the Imperial immediacy to grant the
iempire direct control over the mountain passes. With the extinction of its
imale line in 1263, the Kyburg dynasty fell in AD 1264. The Habsburgs under
iKing Rudolph I (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) laid claim to the Kyburg lands
iand
iannexed them, extending their territory to the eastern Swiss Plateau.[36]
i
iThe Old Swiss Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the
icentral Alps. The Confederacy was governed by nobles and patricians of
ivarious
icantons who facilitated management of common interests and ensured peace on
imountain trade routes. The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the
iconfederacy's founding document, even though similar alliances likely existed
idecades earlier. The document was agreed among the rural communes of Uri,
iSchwyz, and Unterwalden.[38][page needed][39]
i
iBy 1353, the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of Glarus and
iZug and the Lucerne, Zürich and Bern city-states to form the "Old
iConfederacy"
iof eight states that obtained through the end of the 15th century.[39] The
iexpansion led to increased power and wealth for the confederation. By 1460,
ithe confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine
ito the Alps and the Jura mountains, and the University of Basel was founded
i(with a faculty of medicine) establishing a tradition of chemical and medical
iresearch. This increased after victories against the Habsburgs (Battle of
iSempach, Battle of Näfels), over Charles the Bold of Burgundy during the
i1470s, and the success of the Swiss mercenaries. The Swiss victory in the
iSwabian War against the Swabian League of Emperor Maximilian I in 1499
iamounted to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire.[39] In 1501,
iBasel[40] and Schaffhausen joined the Old Swiss Confederacy.[41]
i
iThe Confederacy acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier
iwars, but expansion of the confederation suffered a setback in 1515 with the
iSwiss defeat in the Battle of Marignano. This ended the so-called "heroic"
iepoch of Swiss history.[39] The success of Zwingli's Reformation in some
icantons led to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531 (Wars of
iKappel). It was not until more than one hundred years after these internal
iwars that, in 1648, under the Peace of Westphalia, European countries
irecognised Switzerland's independence from the Holy Roman Empire and its
ineutrality.[36][37]
i
iDuring the Early Modern period of Swiss history, the growing authoritarianism
iof the patriciate families combined with a financial crisis in the wake of
ithe
iThirty Years' War led to the Swiss peasant war of 1653. In the background to
ithis struggle, the conflict between Catholic and Protestant cantons
ipersisted,
ierupting in further violence at the First War of Villmergen, in 1656, and the
iToggenburg War (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.[39]
i
iIn 1798, the revolutionary French government invaded Switzerland and imposed
ia new unified constitution.[39] This centralised the government of the
icountry, effectively abolishing the cantons: moreover, Mülhausen left
iSwitzerland and the Valtellina valley became part of the Cisalpine Republic.
iThe new regime, known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. An
iinvading foreign army had imposed and destroyed centuries of tradition,
imaking
iSwitzerland nothing more than a French satellite state. The fierce French
isuppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the
ioppressive presence of the French Army and the local population's resistance
ito the occupation.[citation needed]
i
iWhen war broke out between France and its rivals, Russian and Austrian forces
iinvaded Switzerland. The Swiss refused to fight alongside the French in the
iname of the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 Napoleon organised a meeting of the
ileading Swiss politicians from both sides in Paris. The Act of Mediation was
ithe result, which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a
iConfederation of 19 cantons.[39] Henceforth, much of Swiss politics would
iconcern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a
icentral government.[citation needed]
i
iIn 1815 the Congress of Vienna fully re-established Swiss independence, and
ithe European powers recognised permanent Swiss neutrality.[36][37][39] Swiss
itroops served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the siege of
iGaeta. The treaty allowed Switzerland to increase its territory, with the
iadmission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva. Switzerland's
iborders saw only minor adjustments thereafter.[42]
i
iThe restoration of power to the patriciate was only temporary. After a period
iof unrest with repeated violent clashes, such as the Züriputsch of 1839,
icivil
iwar (the Sonderbundskrieg) broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried
ito set up a separate alliance (the Sonderbund).[39] The war lasted less than
ia
imonth, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through friendly
ifire. The Sonderbundskrieg had a significant impact on the psychology and
isociety of Switzerland.[citation needed][who?]
i
iThe war convinced most Swiss of the need for unity and strength. Swiss from
iall strata of society, whether Catholic or Protestant, from the liberal or
iconservative current, realised that the cantons would profit more from
imerging
itheir economic and religious interests.[citation needed]
i
iThus, while the rest of Europe saw revolutionary uprisings, the Swiss drew up
ia constitution that provided for a federal layout, much of it inspired by the
iAmerican example. This constitution provided central authority while leaving
ithe cantons the right to self-government on local issues. Giving credit to
ithose who favoured the power of the cantons (the Sonderbund Kantone), the
inational assembly was divided between an upper house (the Council of States,
itwo representatives per canton) and a lower house (the National Council, with
irepresentatives elected from across the country). Referendums were made
imandatory for any amendments.[37] This new constitution ended the legal power
iof nobility in Switzerland.[43]
i
iA single system of weights and measures was introduced, and in 1850 the Swiss
ifranc became the Swiss single currency, complemented by the WIR franc in
i1934.[44] Article 11 of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve
iabroad, marking the end of foreign service. It came with the expectation of
iserving the Holy See, and the Swiss were still obliged to serve Francis II of
ithe Two Sicilies with Swiss Guards present at the siege of Gaeta in
i1860.[citation needed]
i
iAn important clause of the constitution was that it could be entirely
irewritten if necessary, thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than
ibeing modified one amendment at a time.[45][page needed]
i
iThis need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the Industrial
iRevolution that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly.
iThe population rejected an early draft in 1872, but modifications led to its
iacceptance in 1874.[39] It introduced the facultative referendum for laws at
ithe federal level. It also established federal responsibility for defence,
itrade, and legal matters.
i
iIn 1891, the constitution was revised with unusually strong elements of
idirect democracy, which remain unique today.[39]
i
iSwitzerland was not invaded during either of the world wars. During World War
iI, Switzerland was home to the revolutionary and founder of the Soviet Union
iVladimir Illych Ulyanov (Vladimir Lenin) who remained there until 1917.[46]
iSwiss neutrality was seriously questioned by the short-lived Grimm–Hoffmann
iaffair in 1917. In 1920, Switzerland joined the League of Nations, which was
ibased in Geneva, after it was exempted from military requirements.[citation
ineeded]
i
iDuring World War II, detailed invasion plans were drawn up by the
iGermans,[47] but Switzerland was never attacked.[48] Switzerland was able to
iremain independent through a combination of military deterrence, concessions
ito Germany, and good fortune, as larger events during the war
iintervened.[37][49] General Henri Guisan, appointed the commander-in-chief
ifor
ithe duration of the war ordered a general mobilisation of the armed forces.
iThe Swiss military strategy changed from static defence at the borders to
iorganised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled
ipositions high in the Alps, known as the Reduit. Switzerland was an important
ibase for espionage by both sides and often mediated communications between
ithe
iAxis and Allied powers.[49]
i
iSwitzerland's trade was blockaded by both the Allies and the Axis. Economic
icooperation and extension of credit to Nazi Germany varied according to the
iperceived likelihood of invasion and the availability of other trading
ipartners. Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through Vichy
iFrance was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland (together with Liechtenstein)
ientirely isolated from the wider world by Axis-controlled territory. Over the
icourse of the war, Switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees[50] aided by
ithe
iInternational Red Cross, based in Geneva. Strict immigration and asylum
ipolicies and the financial relationships with Nazi Germany raised
icontroversy,
ionly at the end of the 20th century.[51]: 521 
i
iDuring the war, the Swiss Air Force engaged aircraft of both sides, shooting
idown 11 intruding Luftwaffe planes in May and June 1940, then forcing down
iother intruders after a change of policy following threats from Germany. Over
i100 Allied bombers and their crews were interned. Between 1940 and 1945,
iSwitzerland was bombed by the Allies, causing fatalities and property
idamage.[49] Among the cities and towns bombed were Basel, Brusio, Chiasso,
iCornol, Geneva, Koblenz, Niederweningen, Rafz, Renens, Samedan, Schaffhausen,
iStein am Rhein, Tägerwilen, Thayngen, Vals, and Zürich. Allied forces
imaintained that the bombings, which violated the 96th Article of War,
iresulted
ifrom navigation errors, equipment failure, weather conditions, and pilot
ierrors. The Swiss expressed fear and concern that the bombings were intended
ito put pressure on Switzerland to end economic cooperation and neutrality
iwith
iNazi Germany.[52] Court-martial proceedings took place in England. The US
ipaid
iSFR 62,176,433.06 for reparations.[citation needed]
i
iSwitzerland's attitude towards refugees was complicated and controversial;
iover the course of the war, it admitted as many as 300,000 refugees[50] while
irefusing tens of thousands more,[51]: 107  including Jews persecuted by the
iNazis.[51]: 114 
i
iAfter the war, the Swiss government exported credits through the charitable
ifund known as the Schweizerspende and donated to the Marshall Plan to help
iEurope's recovery, efforts that ultimately benefited the Swiss
ieconomy.[51]: 521 
i
iDuring the Cold War, Swiss authorities considered the construction of a Swiss
inuclear bomb.[53] Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of
iTechnology Zürich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic
ipossibility.[54]
iIn 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the
itherapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies.[55] Financial problems
iwith the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial
ifunds from being allocated, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968
iwas seen as a valid alternative. Plans for building nuclear weapons were
idropped by 1988.[56] Switzerland joined the Council of Europe in 1963.[37]
i
iSwitzerland was the last Western republic (the Principality of Liechtenstein
ifollowed in 1984) to grant women the right to vote. Some Swiss cantons
iapproved this in 1959, while at the federal level, it was achieved in
i1971[48][57][failed verification] and, after resistance, in the last canton
iAppenzell Innerrhoden (one of only two remaining Landsgemeinde, along with
iGlarus) in 1990. After obtaining suffrage at the federal level, women quickly
irose in political significance. The first woman on the seven-member Federal
iCouncil executive was Elisabeth Kopp, who served from 1984 to 1989,[48] and
ithe first female president was Ruth Dreifuss in 1999.[58]
i
iIn 1979 areas from the canton of Bern attained independence from the Bernese,
iforming the new canton of Jura. On 18 April 1999, the Swiss population and
ithe
icantons voted in favour of a completely revised federal constitution.[48]
i
iIn 2002 Switzerland became a full member of the United Nations, leaving
iVatican City as the last widely recognised state without full UN membership.
iSwitzerland is a founding member of the EFTA but not the European Economic
iArea (EEA). An application for membership in the European Union was sent in
iMay 1992, but did not advance since rejecting the EEA in December 1992[48]
iwhen Switzerland conducted a referendum on the EEA. Several referendums on
ithe
iEU issue ensued; due to opposition from the citizens, the membership
iapplication was withdrawn. Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually changing to
iconform with that of the EU, and the government signed bilateral agreements
iwith the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been
isurrounded by the EU since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss
ivoters agreed by a 55% majority to join the Schengen treaty, a result that EU
icommentators regarded as a sign of support.[37] In September 2020, a
ireferendum calling for a vote to end the pact that allowed a free movement of
ipeople from the European Union was introduced by the Swiss People's Party
i(SVP).[59] However, voters rejected the attempt to retake control of
iimmigration, defeating the motion by a roughly 63%–37% margin.[60]
i
iOn 9 February 2014, 50.3% of Swiss voters approved a ballot initiative
ilaunched by the Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC) to restrict immigration. This
iinitiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approval) and suburban groups
i(51.2% approval), and isolated towns (51.3% approval) as well as by a strong
imajority (69.2% approval) in Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5%
irejection) and the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) rejected it.[61] In
iDecember 2016, a political compromise with the EU was attained that
ieliminated
iquotas on EU citizens, but still allowed favourable treatment of Swiss-based
ijob applicants.[62] On 27 September 2020, 62% of Swiss voters rejected the
ianti-free movement referendum by SVP.[63]

i===== Geography =====
i
iExtending across the north and south side of the Alps in west-central Europe,
iSwitzerland encompasses diverse landscapes and climates across its 41,285
isquare kilometres (15,940 sq mi).[64]
i
iSwitzerland lies between latitudes 45° and 48° N, and longitudes 5° and 11°
iE. It contains three basic topographical areas: the Swiss Alps to the south,
ithe Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau, and the Jura mountains on the west. The
iAlps are a mountain range running across the central and south of the
icountry,
iconstituting about 60% of the country's area. The majority of the population
ilive on the Swiss Plateau. The Swiss Alps host many glaciers, covering 1,063
isquare kilometres (410 sq mi). From these originate the headwaters of several
imajor rivers, such as the Rhine, Inn, Ticino and Rhône, which flow in the
ifour
icardinal directions, spreading across Europe. The hydrographic network
iincludes several of the largest bodies of fresh water in Central and Western
iEurope, among which are Lake Geneva (Lac Léman in French), Lake Constance
i(Bodensee in German) and Lake Maggiore. Switzerland has more than 1500 lakes
iand contains 6% of Europe's freshwater stock. Lakes and glaciers cover about
i6% of the national territory. Lake Geneva is the largest lake and is shared
iwith France. The Rhône is both the main source and outflow of Lake Geneva.
iLake Constance is the second largest and, like Lake Geneva, an intermediate
istep by the Rhine at the border with Austria and Germany. While the Rhône
iflows into the Mediterranean Sea at the French Camargue region and the Rhine
iflows into the North Sea at Rotterdam, about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles)
iapart, both springs are only about 22 kilometres (14 miles) apart in the
iSwiss
iAlps.[64][65]
i
iForty-eight mountains are 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) or higher in height.[64]
iAt 4,634 m (15,203 ft), Monte Rosa is the highest, although the Matterhorn
i(4,478 m or 14,692 ft) is the best known. Both are located within the Pennine
iAlps in the canton of Valais, on the border with Italy. The section of the
iBernese Alps above the deep glacial Lauterbrunnen valley, containing 72
iwaterfalls, is well known for the Jungfrau (4,158 m or 13,642 ft) Eiger and
iMönch peaks, and its many picturesque valleys. In the southeast the long
iEngadin Valley, encompassing St. Moritz, is also well known; the highest peak
iin the neighbouring Bernina Alps is Piz Bernina (4,049 m or 13,284 ft).[64]
i
iThe Swiss Plateau has greater open and hilly landscapes, partly forested,
ipartly open pastures, usually with grazing herds or vegetable and fruit
ifields, but it is still hilly. Large lakes and the biggest Swiss cities are
ifound there.[64]
i
iSwitzerland contains two small enclaves: Büsingen belongs to Germany, while
iCampione d'Italia belongs to Italy.[66] Switzerland has no exclaves.
i
iThe Swiss climate is generally temperate, but can vary greatly across
ilocalities,[67] from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the
inear-Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. Some valley areas
iin
ithe southern part of Switzerland offer cold-hardy palm trees. Summers tend to
ibe warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall, ideal for
ipastures/grazing.
iThe less humid winters in the mountains may see weeks-long intervals of
istable
iconditions. At the same time, the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion
iduring such periods, hiding the sun.[citation needed]
i
iA weather phenomenon known as the föhn (with an identical effect to the
ichinook wind) can occur any time and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm
iwind, bringing low relative humidity air to the north of the Alps during
irainfall periods on the south-facing slopes. This works both ways across the
ialps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step
ifor oncoming wind. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.
iThe
idriest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain
ibecause arriving clouds lose a lot of their moisture content while crossing
ithe mountains before reaching these areas. Large alpine areas such as
iGraubünden remain drier than pre-alpine areas, and as in the main valley of
ithe Valais, wine grapes are grown there.[68]
i
iThe wettest conditions persist in the high Alps and in the Ticino canton,
iwhich has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time.[68]
iPrecipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year, with a peak
iin summer. Autumn is the driest season, winter receives less precipitation
ithan summer, yet the weather patterns in Switzerland are not in a stable
iclimate system. They can vary from year to year with no strict and
ipredictable
iperiods.[citation needed]
i
iSwitzerland contains two terrestrial ecoregions: Western European broadleaf
iforests and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[69]
i
iSwitzerland's many small valleys separated by high mountains often host
iunique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves offer a rich range of
iplants not found at other altitudes. The climatic, geological and
itopographical conditions of the alpine region make for a fragile ecosystem
ithat is particularly sensitive to climate change.[67][70] According to the
i2014 Environmental Performance Index, Switzerland ranks first among 132
inations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on
ienvironmental public health, its heavy reliance on renewable sources of
ienergy
i(hydropower and geothermal energy), and its level of greenhouse gas
iemissions.[71] In 2020 it was ranked third out of 180 countries.[72] The
icountry pledged to cut GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to the level of
i1990 and plans to reach zero emissions by 2050.[73]
i
iHowever, access to biocapacity in Switzerland is far lower than the world
iaverage. In 2016, Switzerland had 1.0 hectares[74] of biocapacity per person
iwithin its territory, 40 percent less than world average of 1.6. In contrast,
iin 2016, Swiss consumption required 4.6 hectares of biocapacity – their
iecological footprint, 4.6 times as much as Swiss territory can support. The
iremainder comes from other countries and the shared resources (such as the
iatmosphere impacted by greenhouse gas emissions).[74] Switzerland had a 2019
iForest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 3.53/10, ranking it 150th
iglobally out of 172 countries.[75]
i
iAbout 85% of the population live in urban areas.[76][77] Switzerland went
ifrom a largely rural country to an urban one from 1930 to 2000. After 1935
iurban development claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the
iprior 2,000 years. Urban sprawl affects the plateau, the Jura and the Alpine
ifoothills,[78] raising concerns about land use.[79] During the 21st century,
ipopulation growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside.[77]
i
iSwitzerland has a dense network of complementary large, medium and small
itowns.[77] The plateau is densely populated with about 400 people per km2 and
ithe landscape shows uninterrupted signs of human presence.[80] The weight of
ithe largest metropolitan areas – Zürich, Geneva–Lausanne, Basel and Bern –
itend to increase.[77][clarification needed] The importance of these urban
iareas is greater than their population suggests.[77] These urban centers are
irecognised for their high quality of life.[81]
i
iThe average population density in 2019 was 215.2 inhabitants per square
ikilometre (557/sq mi).[82]: 79  In the largest canton by area, Graubünden,
ilying entirely in the Alps, population density falls to 28.0 inhabitants per
isquare kilometre (73/sq mi).[82]: 30  In the canton of Zürich, with its large
iurban capital, the density is 926.8 per square kilometre (2,400/sq
imi).[82]: 76 
i
i===== Government and politics =====
i
iThe Federal Constitution adopted in 1848 is the legal foundation of
iSwitzerland's federal state.[83] A new Swiss Constitution was adopted in 1999
ithat did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure. It outlines
irights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs, divides
ithe
ipowers between the Confederation and the cantons and defines federal
ijurisdiction and authority. Three main bodies govern on the federal
ilevel:[84]
ithe bicameral parliament (legislative), the Federal Council (executive) and
ithe Federal Court (judicial).
i
iThe Swiss Parliament consists of two houses: the Council of States which has
i46 representatives (two from each canton and one from each half-canton) who
iare elected under a system determined by each canton, and the National
iCouncil, which consists of 200 members who are elected under a system of
iproportional representation, reflecting each canton's population. Members
iserve part-time for 4 years (a Milizsystem or citizen legislature).[85] When
iboth houses are in joint session, they are known collectively as the Federal
iAssembly. Through referendums, citizens may challenge any law passed by
iparliament and, through initiatives, introduce amendments to the federal
iconstitution, thus making Switzerland a direct democracy.[83]
i
iThe Federal Council directs the federal government, the federal
iadministration, and serves as a collective Head of State. It is a collegial
ibody of seven members, elected for a four-year term by the Federal Assembly,
iwhich also oversees the council. The President of the Confederation is
ielected
iby the Assembly from among the seven members, traditionally in rotation and
ifor a one-year term; the President chairs the government and executes
irepresentative functions. The president is a primus inter pares with no
iadditional powers and remains the head of a department within the
iadministration.[83]
i
iThe government has been a coalition of the four major political parties since
i1959, each party having a number of seats that roughly reflects its share of
ithe electorate and representation in the federal parliament. The classic
idistribution of 2 CVP/PDC, 2 SPS/PSS, 2 FDP/PRD and 1 SVP/UDC as it stood
ifrom
i1959 to 2003 was known as the "magic formula". Following the 2015 Federal
iCouncil elections, the seven seats in the Federal Council were distributed as
ifollows:
i
iThe function of the Federal Supreme Court is to hear appeals against rulings
iof cantonal or federal courts. The judges are elected by the Federal Assembly
ifor six-year terms.[86]
i
iDirect democracy and federalism are hallmarks of the Swiss political
isystem.[87] Swiss citizens are subject to three legal jurisdictions: the
imunicipality, canton and federal levels. The 1848 and 1999 Swiss
iConstitutions
idefine a system of direct democracy (sometimes called half-direct or
irepresentative direct democracy because it includes institutions of a
irepresentative democracy). The instruments of this system at the federal
ilevel, known as popular rights (German: Volksrechte, French: droits
ipopulaires, Italian: diritti popolari),[88] include the right to submit a
ifederal initiative and a referendum, both of which may overturn parliamentary
idecisions.[83][89]
i
iBy calling a federal referendum, a group of citizens may challenge a law
ipassed by parliament by gathering 50,000 signatures against the law within
i100
idays. If so, a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple
imajority whether to accept or reject the law. Any eight cantons can also call
ia constitutional referendum on federal law.[83]
i
iSimilarly, the federal constitutional initiative allows citizens to put a
iconstitutional amendment to a national vote, if 100,000 voters sign the
iproposed amendment within 18 months.[j] The Federal Council and the Federal
iAssembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counterproposal. Then,
ivoters must indicate a preference on the ballot if both proposals are
iaccepted. Constitutional amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in
iparliament, must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular
ivote
iand the popular cantonal votes.[k][87]
i
iThe Swiss Confederation consists of 26 cantons:[83][90]
i
i*These cantons are known as half-cantons.
i
iThe cantons are federated states. They have a permanent constitutional status
iand, in comparison with other countries, a high degree of independence. Under
ithe Federal Constitution, all 26 cantons are equal in status, except that 6
i(referred to often as the half-cantons) are represented by one councillor
iinstead of two in the Council of States and have only half a cantonal vote
iwith respect to the required cantonal majority in referendums on
iconstitutional amendments. Each canton has its own constitution and its own
iparliament, government, police and courts.[90] However, considerable
idifferences define the individual cantons, particularly in terms of
ipopulation
iand geographical area. Their populations vary between 16,003 (Appenzell
iInnerrhoden) and 1,487,969 (Zürich), and their area between 37 km2 (14 sq mi)
i(Basel-Stadt) and 7,105 km2 (2,743 sq mi) (Grisons).
i
iAs of 2018 the cantons comprised 2,222 municipalities.
i
iUntil 1848, the loosely coupled Confederation did not have a central
ipolitical organisation. Issues thought to affect the whole Confederation were
ithe subject of periodic meetings in various locations.[91]
i
iIn 1848, the federal constitution provided that details concerning federal
iinstitutions, such as their locations, should be addressed by the Federal
iAssembly (BV 1848 Art. 108). Thus on 28 November 1848, the Federal Assembly
ivoted in the majority to locate the seat of government in Bern and, as a
iprototypical federal compromise, to assign other federal institutions, such
ias
ithe Federal Polytechnical School (1854, the later ETH) to Zürich, and other
iinstitutions to Lucerne, such as the later SUVA (1912) and the Federal
iInsurance Court (1917).[1] Other federal institutions were subsequently
iattributed to Lausanne (Federal Supreme Court in 1872, and EPFL in 1969),
iBellinzona (Federal Criminal Court, 2004), and St. Gallen (Federal
iAdministrative Court and Federal Patent Court, 2012).
i
iThe 1999 Constitution does not mention a Federal City and the Federal Council
ihas yet to address the matter.[92] Thus as of 2022, no city in Switzerland
ihas
ithe official status either of capital or of Federal City. Nevertheless, Bern
iis commonly referred to as "Federal City" (German: Bundesstadt, French: ville
ifédérale, Italian: città federale).
i
iTraditionally, Switzerland avoids alliances that might entail military,
ipolitical, or direct economic action and has been neutral since the end of
iits
iexpansion in 1515. Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at
ithe Congress of Vienna in 1815.[93][94] Swiss neutrality has been questioned
iat times.[95][96][97][98] In 2002 Switzerland became a full member of the
iUnited Nations.[93] It was the first state to join it by referendum.
iSwitzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and
ihistorically has served as an intermediary between other states.[93]
iSwitzerland is not a member of the European Union; the Swiss people have
iconsistently rejected membership since the early 1990s.[93] However,
iSwitzerland does participate in the Schengen Area.[99]
i
iMany international institutions have headquarters in Switzerland, in part
ibecause of its policy of neutrality. Geneva is the birthplace of the Red
iCross
iand Red Crescent Movement, the Geneva Conventions and, since 2006, hosts the
iUnited Nations Human Rights Council. Even though Switzerland is one of the
imost recent countries to join the United Nations, the Palace of Nations in
iGeneva is the second biggest centre for the United Nations after New York.
iSwitzerland was a founding member and hosted the League of Nations.[citation
ineeded]
i
iApart from the United Nations headquarters, the Swiss Confederation is host
ito many UN agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the
iInternational Labour Organization (ILO), the International Telecommunication
iUnion (ITU), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
iabout 200 other international organisations, including the World Trade
iOrganization and the World Intellectual Property Organization.[93] The annual
imeetings of the World Economic Forum in Davos bring together business and
ipolitical leaders from Switzerland and foreign countries to discuss important
iissues. The headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
imoved
ito Basel in 1930.[citation needed]
i
iMany sports federations and organisations are located in the country,
iincluding the International Handball Federation in Basel, the International
iBasketball Federation in Geneva, the Union of European Football Associations
i(UEFA) in Nyon, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA)
iand the International Ice Hockey Federation both in Zürich, the International
iCycling Union in Aigle, and the International Olympic Committee in
iLausanne.[101]
i
iSwitzerland is scheduled to become a member of the United Nations Security
iCouncil for the 2023–2024 period.[102]
i
iAlthough not a member, Switzerland maintains relationships with the EU and
iEuropean countries through bilateral agreements. The Swiss have brought their
ieconomic practices largely into conformity with those of the EU, in an effort
ito compete internationally. EU membership faces considerable negative popular
isentiment. It is opposed by the conservative SVP party, the largest party in
ithe National Council, and not advocated by several other political parties.
iThe membership application was formally withdrawn in 2016. The western
iFrench-speaking areas and the urban regions of the rest of the country tend
ito
ibe more pro-EU, but do not form a significant share of the
ipopulation.[103][104]
i
iAn Integration Office operates under the Department of Foreign Affairs and
ithe Department of Economic Affairs. Seven bilateral agreements liberalised
itrade ties, taking effect in 2001. This first series of bilateral agreements
iincluded the free movement of persons. A second series of agreements covering
inine areas was signed in 2004, including the Schengen Treaty and the Dublin
iConvention.[105]
i
iIn 2006, a referendum approved 1 billion francs of supportive investment in
iSouthern and Central European countries in support of positive ties to the EU
ias a whole. A further referendum will be needed to approve 300 million francs
ito support Romania and Bulgaria and their recent admission.
i
iThe Swiss have faced EU and international pressure to reduce banking secrecy
iand raise tax rates to parity with the EU. Preparatory discussions involved
ifour areas: the electricity market, participation in project Galileo,
icooperating with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and
icertificates of origin for food products.[106][needs update]
i
iSwitzerland is a member of the Schengen passport-free zone. Land border
icheckpoints apply on to goods movements, but not people.[107]
i
iThe Swiss Armed Forces, including the Land Forces and the Air Force, are
icomposed mostly of conscripts, male citizens aged from 20 to 34 (in
iexceptional cases up to 50) years. Being a landlocked country, Switzerland
ihas
ino navy; however, on lakes bordering neighbouring countries, armed boats
ipatrol. Swiss citizens are prohibited from serving in foreign armies, except
ifor the Swiss Guards of the Vatican, or if they are dual citizens of a
iforeign
icountry and reside there.[citation needed]
i
iThe Swiss militia system stipulates that soldiers keep their army-issued
iequipment, including personal weapons, at home. Some organisations and
ipolitical parties find this practice controversial.[108] Women can serve
ivoluntarily. Men usually receive military conscription orders for training at
ithe age of 18.[109] About two-thirds of young Swiss are found suitable for
iservice; for the others, various forms of alternative service are
iavailable.[110] Annually, approximately 20,000 persons are trained in recruit
icentres for 18 to 21 weeks. The reform "Army XXI" was adopted by popular vote
iin 2003, replacing "Army 95", reducing the rolls from 400,000 to about
i200,000. Of those, 120,000 are active in periodic Army training, and 80,000
iare non-training reserves.[111]
i
iThe newest reform of the military, Weiterentwicklung der Armee (WEA; English:
iFurther development of the Army), started in 2018 and was expected to reduce
ithe number of army personnel to 100,000 by the end of 2022.[112][113]
i
iOverall, three general mobilisations have been declared to ensure the
iintegrity and neutrality of Switzerland. The first one was held in response
ito
ithe Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. The second was in response to the First
iWorld War outbreak in August 1914. The third mobilisation took place in
iSeptember 1939 in response to the German attack on Poland.[citation needed]
i
iBecause of its neutrality policy, the Swiss army does not take part in armed
iconflicts in other countries, but joins some peacekeeping missions. Since
i2000
ithe armed force department has maintained the Onyx intelligence gathering
isystem to monitor satellite communications.[114]
i
iGun politics in Switzerland are unique in Europe in that 2–3.5 million guns
iare in the hands of civilians, giving the nation an estimate of 28–41 guns
iper
i100 people.[115] As per the Small Arms Survey, only 324,484 guns are owned by
ithe military.[116] Only 143,372 are in the hands of soldiers.[117] However,
iammunition is no longer issued.[118][119]
i
i===== Economy and labour law =====
i
iOrigin of the capital at the 30 biggest Swiss corporations, 2018:[122][l]
i
iSwitzerland has a stable, prosperous and high-tech economy. It is the world's
iwealthiest country per capita in multiple rankings. The country ranks as one
iof the least corrupt countries in the world,[123][124][125] while its banking
isector is rated as "one of the most corrupt in the world".[126] It has the
iworld's twentieth largest economy by nominal GDP and the thirty-eighth
ilargest
iby purchasing power parity. As of 2021, it is the thirteenth largest
iexporter,
iand the fifth largest per capita. Zürich and Geneva are regarded as global
icities, ranked as Alpha and Beta respectively. Basel is the capital of
iSwitzerland's pharmaceutical industry, hosting Novartis, Roche, and many
iother
iplayers. It is one of the world's most important centres for the life
isciences
iindustry.[127]
i
iSwitzerland had the second-highest European rating in the Index of Economic
iFreedom 2023, while also providing significant public services.[128] On a per
icapita basis, nominal GDP is higher than those of the larger Western and
iCentral European economies and Japan,[129] while adjusted for purchasing
ipower, Switzerland ranked 11th in 2017,[130] fifth in 2018[131] and ninth in
i2020.[132]
i
iThe 2016 World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report ranked
iSwitzerland's economy as the world's most competitive;[133] as of 2019, it
iranks fifth globally.[134] The European Union labeled it Europe's most
iinnovative country and the most innovative country in the Global Innovation
iIndex in 2022, as it had done in 2021, 2020 and 2019.[135][136][137][138] It
iranked 20th of 189 countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index.
iSwitzerland's slow growth in the 1990s and the early 2000s increased support
ifor economic reforms and harmonisation with the European Union.[139][140] In
i2020, IMD placed Switzerland first in attracting skilled workers.[141]
i
iFor much of the 20th century, Switzerland was the wealthiest country in
iEurope by a considerable margin (per capita GDP).[142] Switzerland has one of
ithe world's largest account balances as a percentage of GDP.[143] In 2018,
ithe
icanton of Basel-City had the highest GDP per capita, ahead of Zug and
iGeneva.[144] According to Credit Suisse, only about 37% of residents own
itheir
iown homes, one of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe. Housing and
ifood price levels were 171% and 145% of the EU-25 index in 2007, compared to
i113% and 104% in Germany.[145]
i
iSwitzerland is home to several large multinational corporations. The largest
iby revenue are Glencore, Gunvor, Nestlé, Mediterranean Shipping Company,
iNovartis, Hoffmann-La Roche, ABB, Mercuria Energy Group and Adecco.[146]
iAlso,
inotable are UBS AG, Zurich Financial Services, Richemont, Credit Suisse,
iBarry
iCallebaut, Swiss Re, Rolex, Tetra Pak, The Swatch Group and Swiss
iInternational Air Lines.
i
iSwitzerland's most important economic sector is manufacturing. Manufactured
iproducts include specialty chemicals, health and pharmaceutical goods,
iscientific and precision measuring instruments and musical instruments. The
ilargest exported goods are chemicals (34% of exported goods),
imachines/electronics (20.9%), and precision instruments/watches (16.9%).[145]
iThe service sector – especially banking and insurance, commodities trading,
itourism, and international organisations – is another important industry for
iSwitzerland. Exported services amount to a third of exports.[145]
i
iAgricultural protectionism—a rare exception to Switzerland's free trade
ipolicies—contributes to high food prices. Product market liberalisation is
ilagging behind many EU countries according to the OECD.[139] Apart from
iagriculture, economic and trade barriers between the European Union and
iSwitzerland are minimal, and Switzerland has free trade agreements with many
icountries. Switzerland is a member of the European Free Trade Association
i(EFTA).
i
iSwitzerland is considered as the "land of Cooperatives" with the ten largest
icooperative companies accounting for more than 11% of GDP in 2018. They
iinclude Migros and Coop the two largest retail companies in Switzerland.[147]
i
iSwitzerland is a tax haven.[148] The private sector economy dominates. It
ifeatures low tax rates; tax revenue to GDP ratio is one of the smallest of
ideveloped countries. The Swiss Federal budget reached 62.8 billion Swiss
ifrancs in 2010, 11.35% of GDP; however, canton and municipality budgets are
inot counted as part of the federal budget. Total government spending is
icloser
ito 33.8% of GDP. The main sources of income for the federal government are
ithe
ivalue-added tax (33% of tax revenue) and the direct federal tax (29%). The
imain areas of expenditure are in social welfare and finance/taxes. The
iexpenditures of the Swiss Confederation have been growing from 7% of GDP in
i1960 to 9.7% in 1990 and 10.7% in 2010. While the social welfare and finance
isectors and tax grew from 35% in 1990 to 48.2% in 2010, a significant
ireduction of expenditures has been occurring in agriculture and national
idefence; from 26.5% to 12.4% (estimation for the year 2015).[149][150]
i
iSlightly more than 5 million people work in Switzerland;[151] about 25% of
iemployees belonged to a trade union in 2004.[152] Switzerland has a more
iflexible labor market than neighbouring countries and the unemployment rate
iis
iconsistently low. The unemployment rate increased from 1.7% in June 2000 to
i4.4% in December 2009.[153] It then decreased to 3.2% in 2014 and held steady
ifor several years,[154] before further dropping to 2.5% in 2018 and 2.3% in
i2019.[155] Population growth (from net immigration) reached 0.52% of
ipopulation in 2004, increased in the following years before falling to 0.54%
iagain in 2017.[145][156] The foreign citizen population was 28.9% in 2015,
iabout the same as in Australia.[157]
i
iIn 2016, the median monthly gross income in Switzerland was 6,502 francs per
imonth (equivalent to US$6,597 per month).[158] After rent, taxes and pension
icontributions, plus spending on goods and services, the average household has
iabout 15% of its gross income left for savings. Though 61% of the population
imade less than the mean income, income inequality is relatively low with a
iGini coefficient of 29.7, placing Switzerland among the top 20 countries. In
i2015, the richest 1% owned 35% of the wealth.[159] Wealth inequality
iincreased
ithrough 2019.[160]
i
iAbout 8.2% of the population live below the national poverty line, defined in
iSwitzerland as earning less than CHF3,990 per month for a household of two
iadults and two children, and a further 15% are at risk of poverty.
iSingle-parent families, those with no post-compulsory education and those out
iof work are among the most likely to live below the poverty line. Although
iwork is considered a way out of poverty, some 4.3% are considered working
ipoor. One in ten jobs in Switzerland is considered low-paid; roughly 12% of
iSwiss workers hold such jobs, many of them women and foreigners.[158]
i
i===== Education and science =====
i
iEducation in Switzerland is diverse, because the constitution of Switzerland
idelegates the operation for the school system to the cantons.[161] Public and
iprivate schools are available, including many private international schools.
i
iThe minimum age for primary school is about six years, but most cantons
iprovide a free "children's school" starting at age four or five.[161] Primary
ischool continues until grade four, five or six, depending on the school.
iTraditionally, the first foreign language in school was one of the other
iSwiss
ilanguages, although in 2000, English was elevated in a few cantons.[161] At
ithe end of primary school or at the beginning of secondary school, pupils are
iassigned according to their capacities into one of several sections (often
ithree). The fastest learners are taught advanced classes to prepare for
ifurther studies and the matura,[161] while other students receive an
ieducation
iadapted to their needs.
i
iSwitzerland hosts 12 universities, ten of which are maintained at cantonal
ilevel and usually offer non-technical subjects. It ranked 87th on the 2019
iAcademic Ranking of World Universities.[162] The largest is the University of
iZurich with nearly 25,000 students.[163] The Swiss Federal Institute of
iTechnology Zurich (ETHZ) and the University of Zurich are listed 20th and
i54th
irespectively, on the 2015 Academic Ranking of World Universities.[164]
i
iThe federal government sponsors two institutes: the Swiss Federal Institute
iof Technology Zurich (ETHZ) in Zürich, founded in 1855 and the École
iPolytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, founded in 1969,
iformerly associated with the University of Lausanne.[m][165][166]
i
iEight of the world's ten best hotel schools are located in Switzerland.[167]
iIn addition, various Universities of Applied Sciences are available. In
ibusiness and management studies, the University of St. Gallen, (HSG) is
iranked
i329th in the world according to QS World University Rankings[168] and the
iInternational Institute for Management Development (IMD), was ranked first in
iopen programmes worldwide.[169] Switzerland has the second highest rate
i(almost 18% in 2003) of foreign students in tertiary education, after
iAustralia (slightly over 18%).[170][171]
i
iThe Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, located in
iGeneva, is continental Europe's oldest graduate school of international and
idevelopment studies. It is widely held to be one of its most
iprestigious.[172][173]
i
iSwitzerland has birthed many Nobel Prize laureates. They include Albert
iEinstein,[174] who developed his special relativity in Bern. Later, Vladimir
iPrelog, Heinrich Rohrer, Richard Ernst, Edmond Fischer, Rolf Zinkernagel,
iKurt
iWüthrich and Jacques Dubochet received Nobel science prizes. In total, 114
ilaureates across all fields have a relationship to Switzerland.[175][n] The
iNobel Peace Prize has been awarded nine times to organisations headquartered
iin Switzerland.[176]
i
iGeneva and the nearby French department of Ain co-host the world's largest
ilaboratory, CERN,[178] dedicated to particle physics research. Another
iimportant research centre is the Paul Scherrer Institute.
i
iNotable inventions include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), diazepam
i(Valium), the scanning tunnelling microscope (Nobel prize) and Velcro. Some
itechnologies enabled the exploration of new worlds such as the pressurised
iballoon of Auguste Piccard and the Bathyscaphe which permitted Jacques
iPiccard
ito reach the deepest point of the world's oceans.
i
iThe Swiss Space Office has been involved in various space technologies and
iprogrammes. It was one of the 10 founders of the European Space Agency in
i1975
iand is the seventh largest contributor to the ESA budget. In the private
isector, several companies participate in the space industry, such as Oerlikon
iSpace[179] or Maxon Motors.[180]
i
iElectricity generated in Switzerland is 56% from hydroelectricity and 39%
ifrom nuclear power, producing negible CO2. On 18 May 2003, two anti-nuclear
ireferendums were defeated: Moratorium Plus, aimed at forbidding the building
iof new nuclear power plants (41.6% supported),[181] and Electricity Without
iNuclear (33.7% supported) after a moratorium expired in 2000.[182] After the
iFukushima nuclear disaster, in 2011 the government announced plans to end the
iuse of nuclear energy in the following 2 or 3 decades.[183] In November 2016,
iSwiss voters rejected a Green Party referendum to accelerate the phaseout of
inuclear power (45.8% supported).[184] The Swiss Federal Office of Energy
i(SFOE) is responsible for energy supply and energy use within the Federal
iDepartment of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC). The
iagency supports the 2000-watt society initiative to cut the nation's energy
iuse by more than half by 2050.[185]
i
iThe densest rail network in Europe[57][failed verification] spans 5,250
ikilometres (3,260 mi) and carries over 596 million passengers annually as of
i2015.[186] In 2015, each Swiss resident travelled on average 2,550 kilometres
i(1,580 mi) by rail, more than any other European country.[186] Virtually 100%
iof the network is electrified. 60% of the network is operated by the Swiss
iFederal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). Besides the second largest standard gauge
irailway company, BLS AG, two railways companies operate on narrow gauge
inetworks: the Rhaetian Railway (RhB) in Graubünden, which includes some World
iHeritage lines,[187] and the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB), which
ico-operates
iwith RhB the Glacier Express between Zermatt and St. Moritz/Davos.
iSwitzerland
ioperates the world's longest and deepest railway tunnel and the first flat,
ilow-level route through the Alps, the 57.1-kilometre long (35.5 mi) Gotthard
iBase Tunnel, the largest part of the New Railway Link through the Alps (NRLA)
iproject.
i
iSwitzerland has a publicly managed, toll-free road network financed by
ihighway permits as well as vehicle and gasoline taxes. The Swiss
iautobahn/autoroute system requires the annual purchase of a vignette (toll
isticker)—for 40 Swiss francs—to use its roadways, including passenger cars
iand
itrucks. The Swiss autobahn/autoroute network stretches for 1,638 km (1,018
imi)
iand has one of the highest motorway densities in the world.[188]
i
iZurich Airport is Switzerland's largest international flight gateway; it
ihandled 22.8 million passengers in 2012.[189] The other international
iairports
iare Geneva Airport (13.9 million passengers in 2012),[190] EuroAirport Basel
iMulhouse Freiburg (located in France), Bern Airport, Lugano Airport, St.
iGallen-Altenrhein Airport and Sion Airport. Swiss International Air Lines is
ithe flag carrier. Its main hub is Zürich, but it is legally domiciled in
iBasel.
i
iSwitzerland has one of the best environmental records among developed
inations.[191] It is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol. With Mexico and South
iKorea it forms the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG).[192]
i
iThe country is active in recycling and anti-littering programs and is one of
ithe world's top recyclers, recovering 66% to 96% of recyclable materials,
ivarying across the country.[193] The 2014 Global Green Economy Index placed
iSwitzerland among the top 10 green economies.[194]
i
iSwitzerland has an economic system for garbage disposal, which is based
imostly on recycling and energy-producing incinerators.[195] As in other
iEuropean countries, the illegal disposal of garbage is heavily fined. In
ialmost all Swiss municipalities, mandatory stickers or dedicated garbage bags
iallow the identification of disposable garbage.[196]
i
i===== Demographics =====
i
iIn common with other developed countries, the Swiss population increased
irapidly during the industrial era, quadrupling between 1800 and 1990 and has
icontinued to grow.
i
iThe population is about 8.7 million (2020 est.).[198] Population growth was
iprojected into 2035, due mostly to immigration. Like most of Europe,
iSwitzerland faces an ageing population, with a fertility rate close to
ireplacement level.[199] Switzerland has one of the world's oldest
ipopulations,
iwith an average age of 42.5 years.[200]
i
iFourteen percent of men and 6.5% of women between 20 and 24 reported
iconsuming cannabis in the past 30 days,[201] and 5 Swiss cities were listed
iamong the top 10 European cities for cocaine use as measured in
iwastewater.[202][203]
i
iAs of 2020[update], resident foreigners made up 25.7% of Switzerland's
ipopulation.[204] Most of these (83%) were from European countries. Italy
iprovided the largest single group of foreigners, providing 14.7% of total
iforeign population, followed closely by Germany (14.0%), Portugal (11.7%),
iFrance (6.6%), Kosovo (5.1%), Spain (3.9%), Turkey (3.1%), North Macedonia
i(3.1%), Serbia (2.8%), Austria (2.0%), United Kingdom (1.9%), Bosnia and
iHerzegovina (1.3%) and Croatia (1.3%). Immigrants from Sri Lanka (1.3%), most
iof them former Tamil refugees, were the largest group of Asian origin
i(7.9%).[205]
i
i2021 figures show that 39.5% (compared to 34.7% in 2012) of the permanent
iresident population aged 15 or over (around 2.89 million), had an immigrant
ibackground. 38% of the population with an immigrant background (1.1 million)
iheld Swiss citizenship.[206][207]
i
iIn the 2000s, domestic and international institutions expressed concern about
iwhat was perceived as an increase in xenophobia. In reply to one critical
ireport, the Federal Council noted that "racism unfortunately is present in
iSwitzerland", but stated that the high proportion of foreign citizens in the
icountry, as well as the generally successful integration of foreigners,
iunderlined Switzerland's openness.[208] A follow-up study conducted in 2018
ireported that 59% considered racism a serious problem in Switzerland.[209]
iThe
iproportion of the population that claimed to have been targeted by racial
idiscrimination increased from 10% in 2014 to almost 17% in 2018, according to
ithe Federal Statistical Office.[210]
i
iSwitzerland has four national languages: mainly German (spoken natively by
i62.8% of the population in 2016); French (22.9%) in the west; and Italian
i(8.2%) in the south.[213][212] The fourth national language, Romansh (0.5%),
iis a Romance language spoken locally in the southeastern trilingual canton of
iGrisons, and is designated by Article 4 of the Federal Constitution as a
inational language along with German, French, and Italian. In Article 70 it is
imentioned as an official language if the authorities communicate with persons
iwho speak Romansh. However, federal laws and other official acts do not need
ito be decreed in Romansh.
i
iIn 2016, the languages most spoken at home among permanent residents aged 15
iand older were Swiss German (59.4%), French (23.5%), Standard German (10.6%),
iand Italian (8.5%). Other languages spoken at home included English (5.0%),
iPortuguese (3.8%), Albanian (3.0%), Spanish (2.6%) and Serbian and Croatian
i(2.5%). 6.9% reported speaking another language at home.[214] In 2014 almost
itwo-thirds (64.4%) of the permanent resident population indicated speaking
imore than one language regularly.[215]
i
iThe federal government is obliged to communicate in the official languages,
iand in the federal parliament simultaneous translation is provided from and
iinto German, French and Italian.[216]
i
iAside from the official forms of their respective languages, the four
ilinguistic regions of Switzerland also have local dialectal forms. The role
iplayed by dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically: in
iGerman-speaking regions, Swiss German dialects have become more prevalent
isince the second half of the 20th century, especially in the media, and are
iused as an everyday language for many, while the Swiss variety of Standard
iGerman is almost always used instead of dialect for written communication
i(c.f. diglossic usage of a language).[217] Conversely, in the French-speaking
iregions, local Franco-Provençal dialects have almost disappeared (only 6.3%
iof
ithe population of Valais, 3.9% of Fribourg, and 3.1% of Jura still spoke
idialects at the end of the 20th century), while in the Italian-speaking
iregions, the use of Lombard dialects is mostly limited to family settings and
icasual conversation.[217]
i
iThe principal official languages have terms not used outside of Switzerland,
iknown as Helvetisms. German Helvetisms are, roughly speaking, a large group
iof
iwords typical of Swiss Standard German that do not appear in Standard German,
inor in other German dialects. These include terms from Switzerland's
isurrounding language cultures (German Billett[218] from French), from similar
iterms in another language (Italian azione used not only as act but also as
idiscount from German Aktion).[219] Swiss French, while generally close to the
iFrench of France, also contains some Helvetisms. The most frequent
icharacteristics of Helvetisms are in vocabulary, phrases, and pronunciation,
ialthough certain Helvetisms denote themselves as special in syntax and
iorthography. Duden, the comprehensive German dictionary, contains about 3000
iHelvetisms.[219] Current French dictionaries, such as the Petit Larousse,
iinclude several hundred Helvetisms; notably, Swiss French uses different
iterms
ithan that of France for the numbers 70 (septante) and 90 (nonante) and often
i80 (huitante) as well.[220]
i
iLearning one of the other national languages is compulsory for all Swiss
ipupils, so many Swiss are supposed to be at least bilingual, especially those
ibelonging to linguistic minority groups.[221] Because the largest part of
iSwitzerland is German-speaking, many French, Italian, and Romansh speakers
imigrating to the rest of Switzerland and the children of those
inon-German-speaking Swiss born within the rest of Switzerland speak German.
iWhile learning one of the other national languages at school is important,
imost Swiss learn English to communicate with Swiss speakers of other
ilanguages, as it is perceived as a neutral means of communication. English
ioften functions as a lingua franca.[222]
i
i===== Health =====
i
iSwiss residents are required to buy health insurance from private insurance
icompanies, which in turn are required to accept every applicant. While the
icost of the system is among the highest, its health outcomes compare well
iwith
iother European countries; patients have been reported as in general, highly
isatisfied with it.[223][224][225] In 2012, life expectancy at birth was 80.4
iyears for men and 84.7 years for women[226] – the world's highest.[227][228]
iHowever, spending on health at 11.4% of GDP (2010) is on par with Germany and
iFrance (11.6%) and other European countries, but notably less than the US
i(17.6%).[229] From 1990, costs steadily increased.[230]
i
iIt is estimated that one out of six Swiss persons suffers from mental
iillness.[231]
i
i===== Culture =====
i
iSwiss culture is characterised by diversity, which is reflected in diverse
itraditional customs.[232] A region may be in some ways culturally connected
ito
ithe neighbouring country that shares its language, all rooted in western
iEuropean culture.[233] The linguistically isolated Romansh culture in
iGraubünden in eastern Switzerland constitutes an exception. It survives only
iin the upper valleys of the Rhine and the Inn and strives to maintain its
irare
ilinguistic tradition.
i
iSwitzerland is home to notable contributors to literature, art, architecture,
imusic and sciences. In addition, the country attracted creatives during times
iof unrest or war.[234] Some 1000 museums are found in the country.[232]
i
iAmong the most important cultural performances held annually are the Paléo
iFestival, Lucerne Festival,[235] the Montreux Jazz Festival,[236] the Locarno
iInternational Film Festival and Art Basel.[237]
i
iAlpine symbolism played an essential role in shaping Swiss history and the
iSwiss national identity.[16][238] Many alpine areas and ski resorts attract
ivisitors for winter sports as well as hiking and mountain biking in summer.
iThe quieter seasons are spring and autumn. A traditional pastoral culture
ipredominate in many areas, and small farms are omnipresent in rural areas.
iFolk art is nurtured in organisations across the country. Switzerland most
idirectly in appears in music, dance, poetry, wood carving, and embroidery.
iThe
ialphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood has joined yodeling
iand the accordion as epitomes of traditional Swiss music.[239][240]
i
iReligion in Switzerland (age 15+, 2018–2020):[3][b]
i
iChristianity is the predominant religion according to national surveys of
iSwiss Federal Statistical Office[b] (about 67% of resident population in
i2016–2018[242] and 75% of Swiss citizens[243]), divided between the Catholic
iChurch (35.8% of the population), the Swiss Reformed Church (23.8%), further
iProtestant churches (2.2%), Eastern Orthodoxy (2.5%), and other Christian
idenominations (2.2%).[242]
i
iSwitzerland has no official state religion, though most of the cantons
i(except Geneva and Neuchâtel) recognise official churches, either the
iCatholic
iChurch or the Swiss Reformed Church. These churches, and in some cantons the
iOld Catholic Church and Jewish congregations, are financed by official
itaxation of members.[244] In 2020, the Roman Catholic Church had 3,048,475
iregistered and church tax paying members (corresponding to 35.2% of the total
ipopulation), while the Swiss Reformed Church had 2,015,816 members (23.3% of
ithe total population).[245][o]
i
i26.3% of Swiss permanent residents are not affiliated with a religious
icommunity.[242]
i
iAs of 2020, according to a national survey conducted by the Swiss Federal
iStatistical Office,[b] Christian minority communities included Neo-Pietism
i(0.5%), Pentecostalism (0.4%, mostly incorporated in the Schweizer
iPfingstmission), Apostolic communities (0.3%), other Protestant denominations
i(1.1%, including Methodism), the Old Catholic Church (0.1%), other Christian
idenominations (0.3%). Non-Christian religions are Islam (5.3%),[242] Hinduism
i(0.6%), Buddhism (0.5%), Judaism (0.25%) and others (0.4%).[3]
i
iHistorically, the country was about evenly balanced between Catholic and
iProtestant, in a complex patchwork. During the Reformation Switzerland became
ihome to many reformers. Geneva converted to Protestantism in 1536, just
ibefore
iJohn Calvin arrived. In 1541, he founded the Republic of Geneva on his own
iideals. It became known internationally as the Protestant Rome and housed
isuch
ireformers as Theodore Beza, William Farel or Pierre Viret. Zürich became
ianother reform stronghold around the same time, with Huldrych Zwingli and
iHeinrich Bullinger taking the lead. Anabaptists Felix Manz and Conrad Grebel
ialso operated there. They were later joined by the fleeing Peter Martyr
iVermigli and Hans Denck. Other centres included Basel (Andreas Karlstadt and
iJohannes Oecolampadius), Berne (Berchtold Haller and Niklaus Manuel), and St.
iGallen (Joachim Vadian). One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into
iCatholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons
i(Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich and Basel) used to be predominantly
iProtestant. Central Switzerland, the Valais, the Ticino, Appenzell
iInnerrhodes, the Jura, and Fribourg are traditionally Catholic.
i
iThe Swiss Constitution of 1848, under the recent impression of the clashes of
iCatholic vs Protestant cantons that culminated in the Sonderbundskrieg,
iconsciously defines a consociational state, allowing the peaceful
ico-existence
iof Catholics and Protestants.[citation needed] A 1980 initiative calling for
ithe complete separation of church and state was rejected by 78.9% of the
ivoters.[246] Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities nowadays have a
islight Catholic majority, because since about 1970 a steadily growing
iminority
iwere not affiliated with any religious body (21.4% in Switzerland, 2012)
iespecially in traditionally Protestant regions, such as Basel-City (42%),
icanton of Neuchâtel (38%), canton of Geneva (35%), canton of Vaud (26%), or
iZürich city (city: >25%; canton: 23%).[247]
i
iThe earliest forms of literature were in German, reflecting the language's
iearly predominance. In the 18th century, French became fashionable in Bern
iand
ielsewhere, while the influence of the French-speaking allies and subject
ilands
iincreased.[248]
i
iAmong the classic authors of Swiss literature are Jeremias Gotthelf
i(1797–1854) and Gottfried Keller (1819–1890); later writers are Max Frisch
i(1911–1991) and Friedrich Dürrenmatt (1921–1990), whose Das Versprechen (The
iPledge) was released as a Hollywood film in 2001.[249]
i
iFamous French-speaking writers were Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) and
iGermaine de Staël (1766–1817). More recent authors include Charles Ferdinand
iRamuz (1878–1947), whose novels describe the lives of peasants and mountain
idwellers, set in a harsh environment, and Blaise Cendrars (born Frédéric
iSauser, 1887–1961).[249] Italian and Romansh-speaking authors also
icontributed
ito the Swiss literary landscape, generally in proportion to their number.
i
iProbably the most famous Swiss literary creation, Heidi, the story of an
iorphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Alps, is one of the most
ipopular children's books and has come to be a symbol of Switzerland. Her
icreator, Johanna Spyri (1827–1901), wrote a number of books on similar
ithemes.[249]
i
iFreedom of the press and the right to free expression is guaranteed in the
iconstitution.[250] The Swiss News Agency (SNA) broadcasts information in
ithree
iof the four national languages—on politics, economics, society and culture.
iThe SNA supplies almost all Swiss media and foreign media with its
ireporting.[250]
i
iSwitzerland has historically boasted the world's greatest number of newspaper
ititles relative to its population and size.[251][better source needed] The
imost influential newspapers are the German-language Tages-Anzeiger and Neue
iZürcher Zeitung NZZ, and the French-language Le Temps, but almost every city
ihas at least one local newspaper, in the most common local language.[251]
i
iThe government exerts greater control over broadcast media than print media,
iespecially due to financing and licensing.[251] The Swiss Broadcasting
iCorporation, whose name was recently changed to SRG SSR, is charged with the
iproduction and distribution of radio and television content. SRG SSR studios
iare distributed across the various language regions. Radio content is
iproduced
iin six central and four regional studios while video media are produced in
iGeneva, Zürich, Basel, and Lugano. An extensive cable network allows most
iSwiss to access content from neighbouring countries.[251]
i
iSkiing, snowboarding and mountaineering are among the most popular sports,
ireflecting the nature of the country[252] Winter sports are practised by
inatives and visitors. The bobsleigh was invented in St. Moritz.[253] The
ifirst
iworld ski championships were held in Mürren (1931) and St. Moritz (1934). The
ilatter town hosted the second Winter Olympic Games in 1928 and the fifth
iedition in 1948. Among its most successful skiers and world champions are
iPirmin Zurbriggen and Didier Cuche.
i
iThe most prominently watched sports in Switzerland are football, ice hockey,
iAlpine skiing, Schwingen, and tennis.[254]
i
iThe headquarters of the international football's and ice hockey's governing
ibodies, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) and
iInternational Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) are located in Zürich. Many other
iheadquarters of international sports federations are located in Switzerland.
iFor example, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), IOC's Olympic Museum
iand the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) are located in Lausanne.
i
iSwitzerland hosted the 1954 FIFA World Cup and was the joint host, with
iAustria, of the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament. The Swiss Super League is the
ination's professional football club league. Europe's highest football pitch,
iat 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) above sea level, is located in Switzerland, the
iOttmar Hitzfeld Stadium.[255]
i
iMany Swiss follow ice hockey and support one of the 12 teams of the National
iLeague, which is the most attended league in Europe.[256] In 2009,
iSwitzerland
ihosted the IIHF World Championship for the tenth time.[257] It also became
iWorld Vice-Champion in 2013 and 2018. Its numerous lakes make Switzerland an
iattractive sailing destination. The largest, Lake Geneva, is the home of the
isailing team Alinghi which was the first European team to win the America's
iCup in 2003 and which successfully defended the title in 2007.
i
iSwiss tennis player Roger Federer is widely regarded as among the sport's
igreatest players. He won 20 Grand Slam tournaments overall including a record
i8 Wimbledon titles. He won a joint-record 6 ATP Finals.[259] He was ranked
ino.
i1 in the ATP rankings for a record 237 consecutive weeks. He ended 2004,
i2005,
i2006, 2007 and 2009 ranked no. 1. Fellow Swiss players Martina Hingis and
iStan
iWawrinka also hold multiple Grand Slam titles. Switzerland won the Davis Cup
ititle in 2014.
i
iMotorsport racecourses and events were banned in Switzerland following the
i1955 Le Mans disaster with exceptions for events such as hillclimbing. The
icountry continued to produce successful racing drivers such as Clay
iRegazzoni,
iSébastien Buemi, Jo Siffert, Dominique Aegerter, successful World Touring Car
iChampionship driver Alain Menu, 2014 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Marcel
iFässler
iand 2015 24 Hours Nürburgring winner Nico Müller. Switzerland also won the
iA1GP World Cup of Motorsport in 2007–08 with driver Neel Jani. Swiss
imotorcycle racer Thomas Lüthi won the 2005 MotoGP World Championship in the
i125cc category. In June 2007 the Swiss National Council, one house of the
iFederal Assembly of Switzerland, voted to overturn the ban, however the other
ihouse, the Swiss Council of States rejected the change and the ban remains in
iplace.[260][261]
i
iTraditional sports include Swiss wrestling or Schwingen, a tradition from the
irural central cantons and considered the national sport by some. Hornussen is
ianother indigenous Swiss sport, which is like a cross between baseball and
igolf.[262] Steinstossen is the Swiss variant of stone put, a competition in
ithrowing a heavy stone. Practised only among the alpine population since
iprehistoric times, it is recorded to have taken place in Basel in the 13th
icentury. It is central to the Unspunnenfest, first held in 1805, with its
isymbol the 83.5 stone named Unspunnenstein.[263]
i
iThe cuisine is multifaceted. While dishes such as fondue, raclette or rösti
iare omnipresent, each region developed its gastronomy according to the
ivarieties of climate and language, for example, Zürcher Geschnetzeltes,
iengl.:
isliced meat Zürich style.[264] Traditional Swiss cuisine uses ingredients
isimilar to those in other European countries, as well as unique dairy
iproducts
iand cheeses such as Gruyère or Emmental, produced in the valleys of Gruyères
iand Emmental. The number of fine-dining establishments is high, particularly
iin western Switzerland.[265][266]
i
iChocolate has been made in Switzerland since the 18th century. Its reputation
igrew at the end of the 19th century with the invention of modern techniques
isuch as conching and tempering, which enabled higher quality. Another
ibreakthrough was the invention of solid milk chocolate in 1875 by Daniel
iPeter. The Swiss are the world's largest chocolate consumers.[267][268]
i
iDue to the popularisation of processed foods at the end of the 19th century,
iSwiss health food pioneer Maximilian Bircher-Benner created the first
inutrition-based therapy in the form of the well-known rolled oats cereal
idish,
icalled Birchermüesli.[citation needed]
i
iThe most popular alcoholic drink is wine. Switzerland is notable for its
ivariety of grape varieties, reflecting the large variations in terroirs.
iSwiss
iwine is produced mainly in Valais, Vaud (Lavaux), Geneva and Ticino, with a
ismall majority of white wines. Vineyards have been cultivated in Switzerland
isince the Roman era, even though traces of a more ancient origin can be
ifound.
iThe most widespread varieties are the Chasselas (called Fendant in Valais)
iand
iPinot Noir. Merlot is the main variety produced in Ticino.[269][270]
