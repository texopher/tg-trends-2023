iKendrick Perkins breaks down the trade between the Wizards and Suns that
isends Bradley Beal to Phoenix. (1:04)
i
iAdrian Wojnarowski, Senior NBA InsiderJun 18, 2023, 04:31 PM ET
i
iThe Washington Wizards are finalizing a trade to send three-time All-Star
iguard Bradley Beal to the Phoenix Suns for a package expected to include
iChris
iPaul, Landry Shamet, several second-round picks and a picks swap, sources
itold
iESPN on Sunday.
i
iThe Wizards also have agreed to send guard Jordan Goodwin and forward Isaiah
iTodd to the Suns, sources told ESPN.
i
iThe deal could take a few days to be completed, but Beal is on his way to the
iSuns to form a new Big Three with Devin Booker and Kevin Durant, sources
isaid.
i
iOne of the reasons the deal could take a few days to complete will be to
iallow the Wizards to field offers to widen the deal to a three-team trade to
igive Paul the chance to land with a contender, sources told ESPN. Without
ianother trade partner emerging for Paul, the possibility exists of the
iWizards
iand Paul discussing a contract buyout that would allow him to become a free
iagent.
i
i===== Most career PPG, active players =====
i
iBradley Beal, Kevin Durant and Devin Booker all rank among the NBA's top 20
iactive players in career points per game, out of 230 players with at least
i250
igames played.
i
i"This was an extremely complicated process with so many different hurdles to
iget through, and [Wizards owner] Ted Leonsis and [Wizards president] Michael
iWinger were unbelievable partners in making this happen," Beal's agent, Mark
iBartelstein of Priority Sports, told ESPN. "From the day that Ted drafted
iBrad
ihe has been by our side along with [former general managers] Ernie Grunfeld
iand Tommy Sheppard. They've always had Brad's back in every way and now we
ihave experienced the exact same thing with Ted and Michael Winger. We are
iextremely grateful."
i
iBeal is lifting his no-trade clause to accommodate the deal to a Suns
ifranchise that has now realized a top-heavy roster of talent and salary. Beal
iwill join Booker, Durant and Deandre Ayton -- four max contracts together
iwith
ia looming collective bargaining agreement designed to severely limit the
iroster flexibility of teams above the second apron of the luxury tax at
i$179.5
imillion. It is the ultimate all-in play for the Suns to chase a championship.
i
iThe arrival of Beal and the $207 million left on his contract projects the
iSuns to be a second-apron team for at least the next three years, which will
ileave them largely reliant on minimum contracts to fill out the roster.
i
iSuns leadership along with the team's key players were relentless in recent
idays selling Beal on Phoenix as a destination to fulfill his championship
ihopes, sources said.

iOwner Mat Ishbia has made a massive commitment to salary and luxury tax on
ithe Beal and Durant deals to pursue a title in the coming seasons. The Suns
iwill have $163 million in salary committed to Booker, Durant, Beal and Ayton
ifor the 2023-24 season.
i
iBartelstein worked closely with Winger on navigating a deal with Phoenix in
irecent days, talks that included conversations with several teams, sources
isaid. Beal's no-trade clause and his remaining contract with the new CBA
ilooming were impediments to the Wizards getting a more robust return.
i
iUnloading the final four years of Beal's contract clears the way for Winger
ito reshape the roster after the franchise posted losing seasons for five
istraight years, missing the playoffs in four of them. The Suns had no
ifirst-round draft picks available to include in the deal because of the
iBrooklyn Nets' control of them from the Kevin Durant deal.
i
iAfter 11 years with the Wizards -- who drafted him No. 3 overall in 2012 --
iBeal is nearing 30 years old and agreed with Winger that the franchise is
iwithout a quick-fix route to contention.
i
iOnce the Beal trade is completed, the Suns will have made two blockbuster
itrades in the past several months under Ishbia, including the Durant deal.
i
iAfter completing the first season of a five-year, $251 million contract,
iBeal's standing as the NBA's only current player to have a no-trade clause
inegotiated into his deal gave him the ability to control not only possible
idestinations, but how a potential package to acquire him impacted his new
isupporting cast.
i
iBeal's no-trade clause will convey with him to the Suns.
i
iLeonsis gave Winger full autonomy on whether he wants to pursue a rebuild
iwith the Wizards or continue a trajectory around high-priced veteran talent.
iThe Wizards are awaiting player-option decisions on forwards Kyle Kuzma and
iKristaps Porzingis, who both can become unrestricted free agents.
i
iBeal averaged 23.2 points on a career-best 51% shooting in an injury-plagued
iseason in which he played 50 games. He has averaged 22.1 points in his career
i-- including 30.5 and 31.3 averages in 2019-20 and 2020-21, respectively.
