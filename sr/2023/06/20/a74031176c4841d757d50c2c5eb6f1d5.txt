iSouth Korean politician and former prosecutor who is the current Mayor of
iDaegu. He previously served as the governor of South Gyeongsang Province, a
imember of the National Assembly for five terms, and the party leader of the
iconservative Grand National Party in 2011 and its successor incarnation the
iLiberty Korea Party from 2017 to 2018.
i
iHe was the presidential nominee of the Liberty Korea Party in the 2017 South
iKorean presidential election and came in second place during the general
ielection, losing to Moon Jae-in.[3] Hong ran as a candidate in the 2022 South
iKorean presidential election for the nomination of the conservative People
iPower Party and came in second place during the primaries, narrowly losing to
iYoon Suk-yeol.[4]
i
i===== Early life and career =====
i
iHe was born in Changnyeong, South Gyeongsang Province. Hong graduated from
iYeungnam High School[5] and received his undergraduate degree in Public
iAdministration from Korea University.
i
iIn January 1996, Hong joined the New Korea Party. He was elected for the
iSongpa A constituency during the 1996 election and entered the National
iAssembly for the first time.[6]
i
iHong was formerly the chairperson of the Grand National Party(which changed
iits name to the Saenuri Party in 2012 and again changed its name to the
iLiberty Korea Party in 2017). He stepped down as the chairperson on 9
iDecember
i2011[7] and was replaced by future President Park Geun-hye.
i
iOn 20 October 2011, Hong criticized Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon's The Beautiful
iFoundation (아름다운재단) for sending money to left-wing citizen groups.[8] Hong
iwas
iknown to have generated much criticism against Park Won-soon in regards to
iPark's possible allegation of extorting tax money for his oversea visits.[9]
i
iHe considered to rename the Grand National Party to another name after Park
iWon-soon won the October 2011 election.[10]
i
iHong was first elected as Governor of South Gyeongsang Province in 2012, and
ire-elected in 2014.
i
iHong secured the nomination of the Liberty Korea Party. His campaign appealed
ito older, conservative voters with a platform describing Hong as a
i"strongman." Hong has stated he wanted to be a strong man similar to Park
iChung-hee, a former Korean president and dictator who is popular with older
iconservatives[11] and whose daughter Park Geun-hye was recently impeached
iamidst allegations of corruption.
i
iHong finished second among the five major candidates with 24% of the vote
ibehind Moon Jae-in.[3]
i
iHong was elected as the leader of Liberty Korea Party following his loss in
ithe presidential election.[12] After leading the party to a massive loss in
ithe 2018 local elections on 13 June 2018, Hong resigned as party leader on 14
iJune 2018.[2]
i
iOn 17 February 2020, the Liberty Korea Party dissolved and merged with
iseveral other parties to become the United Future Party. Hong left the United
iFuture Party in March 2020 after party leaders decided not to give him a
icandidacy in any of the upcoming 2020 legislative elections.[13] Running as
ian
iindependent candidate, Hong won the National Assembly election of Suseong B
iin
iDaegu on 15 April 2020.
i
iOn 24 June 2021, Hong rejoined the People Power Party (which had formerly
ibeen called the United Future Party until 2 September 2020), and signaled a
ipresidential bid in the upcoming 2022 South Korean presidential election.[13]
i
iOn 29 June 2021, Hong Joon-pyo officially entered the 2022 presidential
ielection.[14] He placed 2nd in the final round of the primaries behind the
iwinner Yoon Seok-yeol, winning 41.5 percent of the votes.[15] On 26 April
i2022, Hong resigned from the National Assembly after he was chosen as the
iPeople Power's nominee for the mayor of Daegu.[6] He would go on to win the
ielection for mayor of Daegu and begin his term on 1 July 2022.[16]
i

i
iFurther information: Chaebol

ialso known as chaebols and wants to reduce the power of labor unions. When
iasked how he would respond to growing concerns around corrupt practices
iamongst chaebols, such as those that brought down former President Park
iGeun-hye's administration, he stated that he would reduce corruption by
iputting it through a "washing machine".[17]
