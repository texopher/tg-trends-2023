i
iArctic Monkeys have announced that their upcoming show in Dublin will be
icancelled due to illness.
i
iThe news was announced earlier today (June 19) on the band’s Instagram page.
iAccording to the update, frontman Alex Turner has been suffering from an
iacute
icase of laryngitis and instructed to rest.
i
iThe upcoming gig was scheduled to take place tomorrow (June 20) at Marley
iPark in Dublin, and would have been the latest date as part of the band’s
iongoing UK stadium tour.
i
iAccording to the update, the newly-cancelled show will not be rescheduled and
iticket holders will be issued refunds over the next few days. The show marked
ithe Sheffield rocker’s only scheduled performance in Ireland.
i
i“We are extremely sorry to announce the cancellation of Arctic Monkeys’ show
iat Marley Park in Dublin Tomorrow,” the update began. “Alex is suffering from
iacute laryngitis, and following medical advice, has been ordered to rest.”

i
i“Alex and the band apologise for the huge disappointment this will inevitably
icause to all their Irish fans. Full refunds will be credited back to the
iticket purchaser’s account by Ticketmaster within the next six working days.”
i
iThe announcement comes just days ahead of the indie veterans’ scheduled
iperformance at this year’s Glastonbury, which they are set to headline on
iFriday (June 23). At the time of writing, the set at Worthy Farm is still set
ito go ahead as planned, and will be preceded by sets from both Royal Blood
iand
imystery band The Churnups.
i
iAlex Turner and co. are also still scheduled to play their upcoming set in
iGlasgow two days later, with a gig planned at Bellahouston Park on Sunday
i(June 25). The show will be the final stop of the ongoing UK tour.
i
iOver the weekend, the band performed three back-to-back shows in London.
iKicking off on Friday (June 16), the residency took place at Emirates Stadium
iin the capital and concluded with a performance last night.
i
iAt last night’s show, the members performed numerous fan favourites including
i‘Do I Wanna Know’, ‘Why’d You Only Call Me When You’re High?’ and
i‘Fluorescent
iAdolescent’. However, the main highlight of the set arrived later, when the
iband were joined onstage by Miles Kane for a rendition of ‘505’.
i
iPrevious stops on the tour included sets in Bristol, Coventry, Manchester,
iNorwich and Swansea — as well as two of their mammoth homecoming shows at
iHillsborough Park. It also featured support slots from Swedish indie rockers
iThe Hives, and Liverpool-based alt-rock band, The Mysterines.
i
iThis is a developing story, and more details are set to be announced shortly.
