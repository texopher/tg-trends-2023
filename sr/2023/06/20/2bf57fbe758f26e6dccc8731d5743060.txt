i
iAjax are currently much closer to signing Arda Guler from Fenerbahce this
isummer despite the interest from AC Milan in the youngster, a report claims.
i
iAs has been reported by Bein Sports (via Calciomercato.com). the Dutch side
iare trying to act fast and make sure that they are in a position to win back
ithe Eredivisie title from Feyenoord next season.
i
iGuler has been heavily linked with a move to Milan for many months now but
ithe deal for him is another that has stalled following the sacking of Paolo
iMaldini and Frederic Massara.
i
iIt seems that, much like Ruben Loftus-Cheek at Chelsea, Guler could be
ianother player that gets away from Milan because the transfer strategy is
istill being finalised by those who suddenly have a lot more responsibility.
i
iThe player should now be available for a €17.5 million release clause fee
iafter he hit his 1,500-minute target with the Turkish side.
i
iA target for many months? If he was you guys missed the boat in reporting it,
ior you’re trying to drum up anger with pathetic journalism. Are you not Milan
ifans? Stop making sh*t up so you can bang out another article.
i
iMy friend you have no obligation to come here and read the articles. SM
ialways quotes the original source, here Beinsports from CalcioMercato. They
irelay the news about Milan, they are not fact checkers, they are not inside
iCasa Milan.
i
iOnly the CM article doesn’t mention “many months” at all, it’s a one liner.
i
iWow man, you’re wild. Relax. And what Milan fan just blindly supports
ieverything the club does?? If that’s how you think a fan should be then you
imust have a negative IQ. You chose to come and click, nobody forced you.
i
iYou’re too wild bro ,relax.
i
iBut I agree with what you say, this Guler kid’s name only coming in last week
ior so and suddenly the repot saying something like this :
i
i“Guler has been heavily linked with a move to Milan for many months now but
ithe deal for him is another that has stalled following the sacking of Paolo
iMaldini and Frederic Massara.
i
iIt seems that, much like Ruben Loftus-Cheek at Chelsea, Guler could be
ianother player that gets away from Milan because the transfer strategy is
istill being finalised by those who suddenly have a lot more responsibility.”
i
iI think this is clearly media trying to ramp up views and comment from viewer
iby blaming the club. Or maybe it’s one of the writer of sempremilan .com that
iis trying to? Who know, I can’t read Italian so I don’t know.
i
iWhat they really wanted to say is that Maldini had him already, but since he
ihas been sacked without reason we can’t buy him anymore and we are screwed.
iThey should shut this website down!!! I don’t read it anymore…
i
iAgree. If there’s nothing to report, report nothing!
i
iLOL. Shocking!!!!!. Wonder why that would be??? Could it be because we have
ito haggle over his $17.5M release clause and ask for a discount while a
iMASSIVE club like Ajax can pay the 17.5M outright???? LOLOLOLO. Pick up that
ired phone Georgio and Stefano – I know a call from you can convince the
iplayer
iand the Turks to sell for cheap!!! 😜😜😜😜
i
iIt’s probably because Ajax can point to a long list of talents that they have
inurtured, matured and sold on – Milan are starting to develop that brochure,
ibut it’s harder to make a case than it is for the likes of Ajax and Dortmund.
iEspecially to the agents who know they’ll get two sets of commission in three
iyears if they get a deal like Bellingham, Antony, Martinez or Haaland had.
i
iBro you are the biggest Negative Nancy on these comments, by a mile. I swear.
iAre you even a fan of the club or do you come here just to vent?
i
iEvery speculation, you have something negative to say. There’s therapy
iavailable for issues like this. You should look into it.
i
iA nabbed that just popped up over the last week (which we don’t even know if
ithere’s any credibility in it or not) and you are already looking for a way
ito
ipoke fun of the current management. You don’t even know what they are really
iplanning and not planning to do in the market.
i
i#clown
i
iRight? Just posting the same “LOL Cardinale’s useless LOLOLOLO” cr*p over and
iover and over….
i
iHahahahaha!! That’s right your that A$$Clown that said we should have blind
ifaith in following the club and called any fan who disagreed with ownership
i“fair weather” LOL.
i
i“What you’re describing is a fair-weather fan. If that’s you, then definitely
iplease go support another team. Otherwise support the colors and the badge,
ithrough “thick & thin”” – @ACM1899
i
iNah pal we are just realistic on what we can and can’t do with a pathetic
ibudget of 35M, a wage cap and apparently a policy that if a youth player
idoesn’t develop in the first year we dump him (most likely for a loss). If
iyour ok with that direction of the club then you are NOT a true fan and are
ijust a BLIND sheep.
i
iIMO it’s right to question ownership – because owners come and go BUT true
ifans are there forever, like myself. As a fan, the only thing we can do is
ihold Ownership accountable when they don’t respect the history of the club
iand
iwant to run us like a business ONLY for profit instead of winning titles. But
iyour just a little sheep that drinks the Kool Aid.
i
iEnjoy dip$hit
i
i100% agreed. People think being a fan is just giving support blindly even
iwhen there’s big issues that have taken place etc. Sorry but if somebody just
iblindly supports a club then what is actually special about it? Why not just
igo support a different club per week blindly? It’s right to question the club
ijust as right as it is to back them.
i
iI never said support them blindly. I just said Juro (and the like) are
italking Doom & Gloom even before any moves had been made. Give the club a
ichance then criticize. Learn to read before try to counter.
i
iHold ownership accountable to what? They haven’t made any moves, Einstein.
iYou’re already talking šhit and they haven’t even pulled the trigger yet. I’m
inot saying RedBird is God’s gift to Milan – I’m just saying wait to see how
ithe first year of their reign plays out before…. being letting your sparkling
ipersonality shine, you Fruit Loop. ( Notice I make no sheep references. Your
iobsession with sheep is disturbing).
i
iRedbird’s First year? I thought last winter operation was run by Redbird
i
iYeah, he is not a fan and you are because he doesn’t think the same as you?
iOr dejan the coward? I am still laughing at you to be honest. At the same
iplace you wrote Frattesi is expensive and how Leao and Tonali and Theo were
ideveloped by Pioli. All of those players cost a similar amount. They weren’t
i5M player that were developed, but 25-40M, each.
i
iLeao Theo and Tonali sure as śhit weren’t developed by Giampaolo….. so that
ileaves Pioli? Hmmmmm… Weird. They became what they are today under Pioli.
iWhat
iare you confused about?
i
iConfused and angry. All. The. Time… I actually posted a reply to Karen
i(Martin) but it hasn’t come through and I sure as hell ain’t going to waste
imore time on him or any of these d*ranged Maldinisti like Zoro Juro Nino etc
i
iThis is how we will be linked with different players and at the end we will
ibuy none. So shameful.
i
iAcmilan wake up to your responsibility buy this guy must we fail to sign
iplayer every time
i
iMilan is stuck in a rock and a hard place with the current policy because the
ihistory doesn’t reflect the current direction. Milan wants young cheap
iplayers
iwith potential for possible sale in the future (or titles, I hv to conclude
ibecause no one has really stated what the direction really is). The problem
iis
ithat there are other clubs with better infrastructure setup and policy for
isuch a thing eg Ajax, Atalanta. It’s incredibly difficult to grow under a big
iclub like Milan in it’s current form (ie won Scudetto and semi UCL). There’s
itoo much pressure due to history and demands from fans. It’s easier as a
iyoung
iplayer to go to smaller teams to develop, get game time and then make a move
ito bigger clubs. To try to do that now would take many many years..first to
ipush fans mentality towards a farm club and then to create an atmosphere
iwhere
ikids are going to develop and leave on a consistent basis
i
iThis is the question that we should ask ourselves with each one of these
ikids.
i
iWhy is he coming to Milan to play Serie A, off the bench, instead of going to
ia league and a club that has a rich history of rounding out player
idevelopment
ifor the big leagues?
i
iAjax has probably the richest tradition of any club of being a stepping stone
iinto the big time. PSV and Feyenoord are not far behind. The Germans have
iexcelled at it recently as have the French.
i
iSerie A is a proctology examination for attacking players, in particular. Not
ito mention that Milan wont even show faith in Daniel Maldini who is better
ithan the players sign and who we are trying to sign.
i
i17.5 million is a bargain price if they believe in him. Should they be
iconvinced he is a generational talent, cough the money up, sort the rest out
ilater. He will recoup that fee in no time if he proves to be excellent. Worse
icase scenario you sell another one of our players further down the line. His
iprice will only go up if he repeats performances in Italy.
i
iback to the investcorp article for exmaple this guy will cost 17.5 mill, they
iwld have bought him easy, and they wld have given us a 60 to 70 mil transfer
ibudget , we dont need 300 mil per window
i
iHe just scored a screamer for national team, we keep waiting and waiting and
iexpecting to get him for 10 mil instead of paying 17 mil and another team
iwill
icome and take him
i
iIt’s Moncada who’s pushing for him It has nothing to do with Maldini (I guess
iPaolo would be against this transfer actually) I guess for young player it
ialways better to move to team like Ajax or Benfica. And Ajax of course will
isell him for 100 mil in 2-3 years
