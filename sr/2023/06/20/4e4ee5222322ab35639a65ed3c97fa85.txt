iAnssumane "Ansu" Fati Vieira (born 31 October 2002) is a Spanish professional
ifootballer who plays as a forward for La Liga club Barcelona and the Spain
inational team.
i
iFati was born in Guinea-Bissau but chose to represent the Spain national team
iafter gaining citizenship.[3] He was one of Spain's most exciting football
italents, and one of the best young players in the world.[4][5][6]
i
i===== Early and personal life =====
i
iHe moved to Sevilla with his family at the age of six, when his older brother
iBraima signed for Sevilla.[7] His other brother, Miguel Fati, is also a
ifootballer.[8] His older cousin, Ença Fati is a footballer in Portugal.[9]
i
iHis father, Bori Fati, is an ex-footballer, who was born in Guinea-Bissau.
iAfter emigrating to Portugal, Bori played for some teams in the lower
ileagues.
iThen he moved to Marinaleda, a small town located near Seville that was
ioffering work to immigrants. After struggling in Marinaleda, he met the
imayor,
iJuan Manuel Sánchez Gordillo, and found a job as a driver. He then settled in
ithe nearby town of Herrera, where Ansu spent most of his childhood, and
istarted his football training. Though born in Guinea-Bissau, Bori has said he
iis "a Sevillian".[10][11]
i
i===== Club career =====
i
iAfter representing local side Herrera and the youth teams of Sevilla, he
ijoined Barcelona's La Masia in 2012, aged ten,[12][13] a year after his
ibrother had made the same move.[14]
i
iOn 24 July 2019, Fati signed his first professional contract with Barcelona,
iagreeing to a deal until 2022.[15] On 25 August, before even appearing with
ithe reserves, Fati made his first team and La Liga debut. He came on as a
ilate-game substitute for goalscorer Carles Pérez in a 5–2 home win over Real
iBetis.[16] Aged 16 years and 298 days, he became the second-youngest player
ito
idebut for the club, only 18 days older than Vicenç Martínez in 1941.[17]
i
iOn 31 August 2019, he scored his first professional goal in a 2–2 away draw
ibetween Barcelona and Osasuna at the age of 16 years and 304 days, becoming
ithe Barcelona senior team's youngest goalscorer ever and the third-youngest
iscorer in the history of La Liga.[18]
i
iOn 14 September 2019, in his first career start, Fati became the youngest
iplayer in the history of La Liga to score and assist in the same match, at
ithe
iage of 16 years and 318 days. Fati scored a goal in the 2nd minute which was
iassisted by Frenkie de Jong and later assisted Frenkie de Jong's goal in the
i7th minute of an eventual 5–2 home win against Valencia.[19][20]
i
iOn 17 September, Fati made his Champions League debut in a 0–0 away draw
iagainst Borussia Dortmund, becoming the youngest player to feature for
iBarcelona in the competition at the age of 16 years and 321 days, breaking
ithe
iprevious record held by Bojan Krkić (17 years and 22 days); he also became
ithe
ithird-youngest player ever to appear in the competition.[21] On 10 December,
iFati became the youngest goalscorer in UEFA Champions League history at the
iage of 17 years and 40 days when he scored the game winner in Barcelona's 2–1
ivictory over Inter Milan at the San Siro.[22]
i
iOn 2 February 2020, Fati became the youngest player to score a brace in La
iLiga, scoring both goals in Barcelona's 2–1 win over Levante.[23] On 5 July,
iBarcelona defeated Villarreal away from home and he scored the fourth goal in
ithe 4–1 win. His goal was the 9,000th in Barça's history.[24] On 9 July 2020,
iFati was sent off after fouling Fernando Calero in the derby match against
iEspanyol. Fati had only entered the match five minutes earlier as a
isecond-half substitute for Nélson Semedo.
i
iOn 23 September 2020, Fati was officially promoted to the first team.[25]
iFour days later, in Barcelona's first match of the 2020–21 La Liga season and
ithe first under new head coach, Ronald Koeman, Fati scored a brace and forced
ia penalty in a 4–0 win over Villarreal.[26][27] He scored again in the
ifollowing match, a 3–0 away win over Celta Vigo on 1 October.[28] His
iperformances led to him being named as the La Liga Player of the Month for
iSeptember 2020.[29] On 20 October, he scored a goal in a 5–1 win over
iFerencváros in the Champions League, to become the first player to score more
ithan one goal in the competition before turning 18.[30] On 24 October, he
iscored a goal in a 1–3 defeat against Real Madrid, to become the second
iyoungest scorer in El Clásico, at 17 years and 359 days, behind Alfonso
iNavarro who scored at 17 years and 356 days on 30 March 1947.[31][32] On 7
iNovember, Fati suffered a knee injury against Real Betis and was subbed off
iat
ihalf-time; tests later confirmed that he tore the meniscus in his left
iknee.[33] Two days later he underwent surgery and the club announced that he
iwould be out for approximately four months.[34] Unfortunately, he was out for
i9 months — he started training after 9 months — ahead of the 2021–22 La Liga
iseason.[35]
i
iAhead of the 2021–22 season, Barcelona announced Fati would inherit the
inumber 10 shirt from Lionel Messi. On 5 August 2021, Ansu Fati returned to
itraining on the pitch at the Ciutat Esportiva after nine months out of
iaction.[36] On 26 September, Fati made his first appearance after 323 days of
iabsence in a 3–0 home victory against Levante. He came on as a substitute,
iplaying for 10 minutes and scoring within minutes after coming on.[37][38] On
i20 January 2022, he suffered a hamstring injury in a 3–2 defeat to Athletic
iBilbao in the Copa del Rey.[39] On 1 May, he returned after a three-month
iinjury absence to play in a 2–1 win against Mallorca.[40]
i
i===== International career =====
i
iFati was originally eligible to represent Guinea-Bissau at international
ilevel, but did not represent the nation of his birth at any level. After his
idebut in La Liga, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) showed
iinterest
iin him, with Diario AS reporting that the Spanish government had set its
isights on granting Fati citizenship with a view to including him in the squad
ifor the 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup. He was also reportedly eligible for a
iPortuguese passport through his grandparents' birth in colonial Portuguese
iGuinea.[41]
i
iFati was granted Spanish citizenship on 20 September 2019,[42][43] renouncing
ihis Bissau-Guinean citizenship.[44] He was called up to the Spain under-21
iteam on 11 October 2019, following an injury to Carles Pérez.[45] Fati made
ihis debut for the Spain under-21 team on 15 October 2019 against
iMontenegro.[46]
i
iFati received his first call up to the full Spain squad on 20 August 2020,
ifor the initial two matches of the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League.[47] He made
ihis full international debut on 3 September 2020, coming off the bench for
ithe
isecond 45 minutes in a 1–1 draw to Germany.[48] He scored his first goal in
ihis first international start on 6 September 2020, scoring Spain's third goal
iagainst Ukraine to be the national team's youngest ever goalscorer at the age
iof 17 years and 311 days;[49] hence, breaking the 95-year record of Juan
iErrazquin, aged 18 years and 344 days.[50] He also became the youngest player
ito start a match in the UEFA Nations League, breaking the previous record of
iWelsh player Ethan Ampadu in 2018, aged 17 years and 357 days.[51] Both these
irecords were beaten by his teammate at Barcelona, Gavi, on 5 June 2022.[52]
i
iOn 11 November 2022, it was announced that Fati would be part of Spain's 2022
iFIFA World Cup squad.[53] He played two games – both as a substitute – as
iSpain were knocked out by Morocco in the round of 16.[54][55]
i
i===== Style of play =====
i
iWidely considered by several pundits to be one of the most talented and
ipromising young players in the world,[4][5][6] Fati's playing style has been
icompared with that of former Barcelona player Lionel Messi.[56] A versatile
iforward, Fati is capable of playing in any attacking position; he started his
icareer as a striker, although he was later moved to the position of left
iwinger. Being adept with either foot, despite being naturally right-footed,
ihe
iis also capable of playing on the right flank, in the centre as a false 9, as
ia second striker or number 11, or in a free role as an attacking midfielder
ior
inumber 10.[57][58][59][60] A 2019 profile by FourFourTwo magazine described
ihim with the following words: "Standing at 5ft 10in, Fati boasts a powerful
iframe and brings a physical approach to the game which is often lacking among
ia technically gifted Barcelona side. Nevertheless, despite his robust
iphysique, the La Masia graduate possesses outstanding dribbling skills which,
iwhen combined with his speed, makes him incredibly difficult to stop in
ione-on-one situations." It also highlighted his eye for goal and ability in
ithe air, as well as his vision and ability to control play from midfield.[57]
iHis perceived selfishness and decision-making were instead highlighted as
iweaknesses in his game.[57] Tor-Kristian Karlsen of ESPN described Fati as a
i"generational talent" in 2021, praising him for his speed, acceleration,
iambidexterity, low centre of gravity, and technical skills, which make him
idifficult to dispossess, also noting his intelligence, movement, defensive
iwork-rate, and link-up play as some of his main strengths.[58]
