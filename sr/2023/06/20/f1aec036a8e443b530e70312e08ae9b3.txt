i===== History =====
i
iThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2019)
i
iMetrobus was founded on February 4, 1973, after acquiring DC Transit,
iWashington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company (WV&M), Alexandria, Barcroft
iand Washington Transit Company (AB&W) and the Washington Marlboro and
iAnnapolis Motor Lines (WM&A) to combine into Metrobus.[1][5] During its
ifounding, WMATA dropped transfer charges, extended senior citizen discounts
iregion-wide and began fare reductions on routes formerly served by the
idifferent carriers at different rates. WMATA also unified a new bus livery
iwith red, white and blue paint scheme and purchased 620 buses from AM General
iwith the last buses being delivered in 1974.[6] Today, Metrobus serves the
ination's capital 24/7, with over 1,500 buses.
i
i===== Fares =====
i
iSee also: SmarTrip
i
iAs of June 25, 2017[update], the Metrobus fare structure is as follows for
icash and SmarTrip:[7]
i
iDiscounts are available for senior citizens, people with disabilities and
iD.C. students.
i
iUp to two children, per paying adult, under 5 years of age ride for free.
iChildren at least 5 years of age pay adult fare.
i
iAll Metrobuses have SmarTrip card readers which automatically deduct the
icorrect fare from a rider's SmarTrip card (including transfer credit).
i
iMetrobus issued paper transfers until January 4, 2009. Transfers are now
icurrently attainable only through SmarTrip cards.
i
iOn June 27, 2010, the transfer window was reduced from 3 hours to 2 hours.[8]
i
iAll fares were free from mid-March 2020 to January 3, 2021, due to the
iCOVID-19 pandemic.[9] On December 6, 2022, the Council of the District of
iColumbia voted to abolish fares within city limits from July 1, 2023.[10]
i
i===== Fleet =====
i
iMain article: Metrobus fleet (Washington, D.C.)
i
iOn July 4, 2018, WMATA awarded a 5-year contract to New Flyer for up to 694
ibuses, order consist of forty-foot CNG, forty-foot clean diesel, sixty-foot
iCNG, and sixty-foot diesel heavy-duty transit buses.[11] These new buses will
ireplace Metro's older New Flyer Low Floor buses, which were delivered between
i2005 and 2007. Red/Silver painted buses will be used on local routes and
iBlue/Silver buses will be used on limited stop routes. These buses will have
ieither Local or MetroExtra on the top of each side of the bus for easy
iidentification.[12]
i
iWMATA is adding a total of 533 hybrid buses to replace its diesel bus fleet.
iEach new "New Flyer Xcelsior XDE40" bus costs $571,737 and is expected to
ibreak down less frequently as well as offer greater fuel economy. With the
ilatest purchase of 152 hybrid buses for $89.3 million from New Flyer of
iAmerica, WMATA's Metrobus fleet will consist of 297 diesel buses, 800 hybrid
ibuses and 458 natural gas fueled buses.[13] Additionally, WMATA placed an
iorder for 110 new buses from New Flyer on September 18, 2019.[14]
i
iAccording to a Sierra Club report, in 2020 WMATA received $4.1 million in
ifunding from the Federal Transit Administration for the purchase of electric
ibuses and charging infrastructure. The report estimated that 50%
ielectrification would reduce the WMATA fleet's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
iby more than 58,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year.[15]
i
i===== Divisions =====
i
iThere are 9 divisions (a.k.a. depots) in the Metrobus system.[16]
i

iMain article: Richmond Highway Express
i
iRichmond Highway Express, a.k.a. "REX", is a Limited-Stop bus line that
ioperates between King Street–Old Town station and Fort Belvoir along the
iRichmond Highway corridor in Fairfax County, Virginia. All REX runs take
iplace
ion board on any local bus from Cinder Bed Division. REX began service on
iSeptember 26, 2004, replacing parts of the now-former route 9A (which
ioperated
ibetween Huntington and Pentagon stations until it was eliminated on June 26,
i2016).[28] The original REX bus fleet consisted of 12 now-retired 2000 Orion
i06.501 (VI) buses wrapped (but not painted) in the blue-and-gold color scheme
i(2073–2084) before the aforementioned Orion 07.501 CNG buses arrived in 2006.
iThe second REX fleet consisted of 12 now-retired 2006 Orion 07.501 (VII) CNG
ibuses (2674–2685) painted in the blue-and-gold color scheme until they were
iall repainted between June and August 2014. The third REX fleet were
iconsisted
iof 12 2010 New Flyer DE40LFA diesel-electric hybrid buses (6550–6561) painted
iin the blue-and-gold color scheme before being repainted from June 2018 back
iinto the Red Local Scheme due to the units being rehabilitated. The fourth
iand
imost recent REX fleet consisted of 12 2008 New Flyer DE40LFA buses painted in
ithe blue-and-gold color scheme. The entire REX fleet has been retired as of
iDecember 26, 2021; from that date onward, the REX route has been operated
ientirely with regular Metrobuses.

i
iMetroway is a bus rapid transit (BRT) service that began on August 24, 2014.
iThe first phase is the Crystal City/Potomac Yard Transitway, which operates
ion
iRoute 1 in Arlington and Alexandria, Virginia.[30] It is a 5-mile (8.0 km)
icorridor with 33 platforms and 20 stations located between Pentagon City and
iBraddock Road.[31] The first 0.8 mile segment in Alexandria runs on a transit
ilane only. The Arlington County segment began construction in the summer of
i2014 and opened April 17, 2016. Metroway originally operated between the
iBraddock Road and Crystal City stations and was expanded to Pentagon City in
iApril 2016.[32] Thirteen 2016 New Flyer Xcelsior XN40 CNG buses (2981–2993)
ioperate with the blue-and-white Metroway livery. The original Metroway fleet
iconsisted of thirteen 2014 NABI 42 BRT diesel-electric hybrid buses
i(8002–8014) until they were all repainted in December 2016. The Metroway
iservice, which is operated by Metrobus' Four Mile Run bus division, features
idedicated bus lanes, transit signal priority, real-time information, custom
idesigned shelters and stations, as well as near-level boarding at station
iplatforms. A Metroway fare costs the same as Metrobus, which is $2.00 (using
icash & SmarTrip).
