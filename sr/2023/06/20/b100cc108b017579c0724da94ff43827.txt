i
iEngland have thrashed North Macedonia 7-0 at Old Trafford to extend their
iperfect record in qualifying matches for the 2024 European Championship.
i
iBukayo Saka scored his first career England hat-trick, Harry Kane added a
ipair of goals, and Marcus Rashford and Kalvin Phillips got on the scoresheet
ias well.
i
iThe result goes down as the heaviest defeat in North Macedonia's history.

i===== Saka: 'I will remember this for the rest of my life' =====
i
iBukayo Saka also spoke to the BBC after his hat-trick: "I will remember this
ifor the rest of my life. It's a special night, big win and my first
ihat-trick,
iit's really special.
i
i"I don’t remember the last time I scored three, even at junior levels. It is
ia decent scoring record (11 goals in 28 England games) but there is always
iroom for improvement.
i
i"After this game, it is time for holidays now.
i
i"I will probably frame the match ball but probably hold it in my arms for a
ifew days first."

i
i===== Southgate: 'All the credit is with' Saka =====
i
iGareth Southgate spoke to the BBC about England's 7-0 win: "Really pleasing.
iI thought there was a fabulous atmosphere in the stadium before the game and
ithat gave everybody a huge lift. It was a brilliant night to play football.
iThe weather was good, the pitch was immaculate, the crowd were buzzing.
i
i"What pleased me the most was that every time we lost the ball the hunger to
iwin it back really set the tone for the performance. Then the quality of the
iplay was good and the finishing was ruthless. For the players to have the
imentality they have to work, at the late stage of this monster of all
iseasons,
ithere was every excuse to do that and they've not done that.
i
i"There were boys coming back from the biggest week of their lives
iprofessionally. We had boys who had two weeks on the beach and could have
iapproached that differently but I think what we are trying to build was
iapparent for everyone tonight."
i
iOn Bukayo Saka's hat-trick: "All the credit is with him. He works incredibly
ihard. He's talented, he's humble. He's hugely popular with all of the players
iand all of the staff and I have to say his finishing has been like that all
iweek. We weren't surprised by the first one, that's how he's been all week.
iWe
ihadn't seen the second one coming!
i
i"I am delighted for him. He's had a slightly sore Achilles and it's another
ione where it would have been easy to lull out on the camp and miss out on a
inight like this that I'm sure will live with him forever."

i===== Milevski: 'It went downhill' after first goal =====
i
iNorth Macedonia manager Blagoja Milevski spoke to the media after his team's
iheavy defeat: "We had our tactical ideas before the game and we fulfilled
ithem
iup until the first goal. Afterwards it went downhill and the quality of the
iopponent was evident after that.
i
i"We have to congratulate (England), our opponent was too strong.
i
i"After the emotions and exhaustion that we suffered against Ukraine, it was
iobvious the players had been affected by that, but we had to be ready to go
itwo levels up to compete against a team like this."
i
iNorth Macedonia lost 3-2 at home against Ukraine on Friday, surrendering a
itwo-goal lead in the process.

i
i===== The road ahead =====
i
iHalfway through the group stage of Euro 2024 qualification, England find
ithemselves in a dominant position having taken four wins from four matches.
i
iThey resume their qualification campaign in September - here's how the rest
iof the schedule looks:
i
iJune 19, 2023 at 4:53 PM EDT
i
i===== Saka: 'They couldn't handle us' =====
i
iBukayo Saka spoke to Channel 4 on the pitch after scoring his first career
iEngland hat-trick: "It's a feeling I can't put into words. I can't describe
ihow I'm feeling right now. I'm so happy."
i
iHis favourite goal? "I like the first one but I'll go for the second goal.
iVolley outside the box, top corner.
i
i"Tonight was a really special display. We went out with me and (Rashford)
idown the wings. Sharp, direct. They couldn't handle us."
i
iOn Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield: "He's a top player. At half-time he
isaid to me he was going to do that pass. When I scored I was looking for him
ito thank him. I didn't have to break my stride.
i
i"It's been a really long season. It's the end of the season now. I couldn't
ihave ended it in a better way. Time to relax and have a break.
i
i"Perfect end to the season. We're really happy with the way the fans turned
iout and supported us."
i
iJune 19, 2023 at 4:49 PM EDT
i
i===== Saka is integral to this England side =====
i
iHarry Kane is understandably the first name on the England team-sheet.
i
iBukayo Saka might well be the second, though.
i
iJune 19, 2023 at 4:49 PM EDT
i
i===== Group standings =====
i
iHere's how the Group C table looks after England's big win over North
iMacedonia and Ukraine's win over Malta earlier today:
i
iGP = Games played, Pts = Points
i
iThe top two spots in each group qualify for Euro 2024.
i
iJune 19, 2023 at 4:47 PM EDT
i
i===== Career night for Saka =====
i
iWhat a performance from England. A thoroughly enjoyable watch in the end with
iBukayo Saka the star of the show. Job done and the Old Trafford crowd go home
ihappy.
i
iSaka has the match ball under his arm and is getting a big round of applause
ias he leaves the pitch. He's the last England player out there as they all
ihead off to the changing rooms.
i
iHopefully Saka has a nice holiday booked - he's more than earned it!

i
i===== Record-setting performance =====
i
iEngland have handed North Macedonia their heaviest defeat ever. The previous
ilow for the Balkan nation's team had been a five-goal defeat, which they had
isuffered four times.

i
i===== FT: England 7-0 North Macedonia =====
i
iNo stoppage time at all as the referee mercifully puts the North Macedonians
iout of their misery.
i
iWhat a show England just put on!
i
iJune 19, 2023 at 4:36 PM EDT
i
i===== Saka is still only 21! =====
i
i88' England 7-0 North Macedonia
i
iAt the age of 21 years and 287 days, Bukayo Saka is the youngest man to score
ia hat-trick for England since Theo Walcott did so at the age of 19 years and
i178 days against Croatia in September 2008.
i
iSaka is also the first Arsenal player to score an England men's hat-trick
isince Walcott in 2008.

iJune 19, 2023 at 4:28 PM EDT
i
i===== Relentless England =====
i
i81' England 7-0 North Macedonia
i
iOk lads, I think this one is wrapped up now. Several Manchester City players
iwere included in all those substitutes from Southgate which, considering
itheir
imultiple days of drinking to celebrate winning the Treble last week, is about
ias kind as he could have been with the scoreline so high.
i
iEven that hasn't stopped them though, with Grealish cutting inside to set up
iPhillips' goal.
i
iMore goals at this point would be cruel but England are in North Macedonia's
ihalf and are showing no signs of sitting back.
i
iJune 19, 2023 at 4:24 PM EDT
i
i===== Pair of bookings =====
i
i77' England 7-0 North Macedonia
i
iPhillips and Bejtulai have both been shown yellow cards in the past few
iminutes.
i
iJune 19, 2023 at 4:22 PM EDT
i
i===== GOAL! England hit seven! =====
i
i74' England 7-0 North Macedonia
i
iKane sends Dimitrievski the wrong way and England have a seventh! He is
iimmediately taken off and replaced by Wilson.
i
iHe gives a wry smile as he leaves the pitch, perhaps knowing how close that
ipenalty was to being taken by Wilson instead of him.
i
iJune 19, 2023 at 4:20 PM EDT
i
i===== PENALTY for England! =====
i
i72' England 6-0 North Macedonia
i
iStones is pulled back by Bejtulai as he darts into the box on an England
icorner, and after a brief hesitation the referee blows the whistle and points
ito the spot!
i
iKane steps up to take it...
i
iJune 19, 2023 at 4:17 PM EDT
i
i===== Phillips celebrates first career England goal =====

i
iJune 19, 2023 at 4:15 PM EDT
i
i===== Fourth change for North Macedonia =====
i
i67' England 6-0 North Macedonia
i
iNorth Macedonia make their fourth change, bringing on Dav. Babunski for
iBardhi.
i
iJune 19, 2023 at 4:12 PM EDT
i
i===== GOAL! England domination! =====
i
i64' England 6-0 North Macedonia
i
iKalvin Phillips scores his first career England goal with a simple tap-in
iafter Kane contested for a cross at the opposite post!
i
iJune 19, 2023 at 4:10 PM EDT
i
i===== Saka is unstoppable =====
i
i61' England 5-0 North Macedonia
i
iTime to be honest here - as someone who doesn't watch live Premier League
ifootball every week it's sometimes easy to forget how good a player like
iBukayo Saka is but boy do I know it now!
i
iHis first England hat-trick and what a lovely trio of finishes. That volley
ifor the second goal will live long in the memory - a great pass from Trent
iAlexander-Arnold but there was a lot to do and Saka just made it look easy.
iHe's having the time of his life out there.

iJune 19, 2023 at 4:07 PM EDT
i
i===== Seven subs =====
i
i59' England 5-0 North Macedonia
i
iWith this game's result decided, both sides make several changes.
i
iEngland: Grealish, Foden, Phillips and Gallagher replace Rashford, Henderson,
iSaka and Rice.
i
iNorth Macedonia: Atanasov, Serafimov and Dor. Babunski replace Ademi, Zajkov
iand Trajkovski.
