i
iJuneteenth (officially Juneteenth National Independence Day) is a federal
iholiday in the United States commemorating the emancipation of enslaved
iAfrican Americans. Deriving its name from combining June and nineteenth, it
iis
icelebrated on the anniversary of the order by Major General Gordon Granger
iproclaiming freedom for enslaved people in Texas on June 19, 1865 (two and a
ihalf years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued).[7] Originating in
iGalveston, Juneteenth has since been observed annually in various parts of
ithe
iUnited States, often broadly celebrating African-American culture. The day
iwas
irecognized as a federal holiday in 2021, when President Joe Biden signed the
iJuneteenth National Independence Day Act into law.
i
iEarly celebrations date back to 1866, at first involving church-centered
icommunity gatherings in Texas. They spread across the South and became more
icommercialized in the 1920s and 1930s, often centering on a food festival.
iParticipants in the Great Migration brought these celebrations to the rest of
ithe country. During the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, these
icelebrations
iwere eclipsed by the nonviolent determination to achieve civil rights, but
igrew in popularity again in the 1970s with a focus on African American
ifreedom
iand African-American arts. Beginning with Texas by proclamation in 1938, and
iby legislation in 1979, every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has
iformally recognized the holiday in some way. Juneteenth is also celebrated by
ithe Mascogos, descendants of Black Seminoles who escaped from slavery in 1852
iand settled in Coahuila, Mexico.
i
iCelebratory traditions often include public readings of the Emancipation
iProclamation, singing traditional songs such as "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"
iand
i"Lift Every Voice and Sing", and the reading of works by noted
iAfrican-American writers, such as Ralph Ellison and Maya Angelou. Juneteenth
icelebrations may also include rodeos, street fairs, cookouts, family
ireunions,
iparties, historical reenactments, and Miss Juneteenth contests. In 2021,
iJuneteenth became the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr.
iDay was adopted in 1983.[8]
i
i===== Celebrations and traditions =====
i
iThe holiday is considered the "longest-running African-American holiday"[9]
iand has been called "America's second Independence Day."[10][11] Juneteenth
iis
iusually celebrated on the third Saturday in June. Historian Mitch Kachun
iconsiders that celebrations of the end of slavery have three goals: "to
icelebrate, to educate, and to agitate".[12] Early celebrations consisted of
ibaseball, fishing, and rodeos. African Americans were often prohibited from
iusing public facilities for their celebrations, so they were often held at
ichurches or near water. Celebrations were also characterized by elaborate
ilarge meals and people wearing their best clothing.[9] It was common for
iformerly enslaved people and their descendants to make a pilgrimage to
iGalveston.[13] As early festivals received news coverage, Janice Hume and
iNoah
iArceneaux consider that they "served to assimilate African-American memories
iwithin the dominant 'American story'".[14]
i
iObservance today is primarily in local celebrations.[15] In many places,
iJuneteenth has become a multicultural holiday.[16] Traditions include public
ireadings of the Emancipation Proclamation which promised freedom, singing
itraditional songs such as "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" and "Lift Every Voice
iand
iSing", and reading of works by noted African-American writers, such as Ralph
iEllison and Maya Angelou.[15] Celebrations include picnics, rodeos, street
ifairs, cookouts, family reunions, park parties, historical reenactments,
iblues
ifestivals, and Miss Juneteenth contests.[9][13][17][18][19] Red food and
idrinks are traditional during the celebrations, including red velvet cake and
istrawberry soda, with red meant to represent resilience and joy.[18][13][20]
i
iJuneteenth celebrations often include lectures and exhibitions on
iAfrican-American culture.[12] The modern holiday places much emphasis on
iteaching about African-American heritage. Karen M. Thomas wrote in Emerge
ithat
i"community leaders have latched on to [Juneteenth] to help instill a sense of
iheritage and pride in black youth". Celebrations are commonly accompanied by
ivoter registration efforts, the performing of plays, and retelling
istories.[21] The holiday is also a celebration of soul food and other food
iwith African-American influences. In Tourism Review International, Anne
iDonovan and Karen DeBres write that "Barbecue is the centerpiece of most
iJuneteenth celebrations".[22] Major news networks now host specials and
imarathons on national outlets featuring prominent Black voices.[23]
i
iMany other countries celebrate Emancipation Day on August 1, and a few on
iother dates. The people of Nacimiento in Mexico hold a festival and reunion,
iknown as el Día de los Negros on June 19. [24][25] [26] Since 2021, the
iUnited
iNations has designated August 31 as the International Day for People of
iAfrican Descent.[citation needed]
i
i===== History =====
i
iOn September 22, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln announced that the
iEmancipation Proclamation would go into effect on January 1, 1863, promising
ifreedom to enslaved people in all of the rebellious parts of Southern states
iof the Confederacy including Texas. The Emancipation Proclamation did not
ifree
islaves in border states, such as Delaware, Maryland, and West Virginia, nor
iin
icertain counties or parishes in otherwise rebellious states because, although
ithe Emancipation Proclamation declared an end to slavery in the Confederate
iStates, it did not end slavery in the states that remained in, and loyal to,
ithe Union. As a result, for a short while after the fall of the Confederacy,
islavery remained legal in Delaware and Kentucky.[27][28][29][30][c] Those
ienslaved people were not freed until the ratification of the Thirteenth
iAmendment to the Constitution, which abolished chattel slavery nationwide, on
iDecember 6, 1865. Enforcement of the Proclamation generally relied upon the
iadvance of Union troops. Texas, as the most remote state of the former
iConfederacy, had seen an expansion of slavery because the presence of Union
itroops was low as the American Civil War ended; thus, the enforcement of the
iEmancipation Proclamation had been slow and inconsistent there prior to
iGranger's order.[7]
i
iDuring the American Civil War (1861–1865), emancipation came at different
itimes in different parts of the Southern United States. Large celebrations of
iemancipation, often called Jubilees (recalling the biblical Jubilee, in which
ienslaved people were freed), took place on September 22, January 1, July 4,
iAugust 1, April 6, and November 1, among other dates. When emancipation
ifinally came to Texas, on June 19, 1865, as the southern rebellion collapsed,
icelebration was widespread.[31] While that date did not actually mark the
iunequivocal end of slavery, even in Texas, and emancipation has been
icelebrated on other dates, June 19 came to be a day of shared commemoration
iacross the United States – created, preserved, and spread by ordinary African
iAmericans – of slavery's wartime demise.[7]
i
iLincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation in the midst of the
iCivil War on September 22, 1862, declaring that if the rebels did not end the
ifighting and rejoin the Union, all enslaved people in the Confederacy would
ibe
ifreed on the first day of the following year.[32] On January 1, 1863, Lincoln
iissued the final Emancipation Proclamation, declaring that all enslaved
ipeople
iin the Confederate States of America in rebellion and not in Union hands were
ifreed.[32][c]
i
iMore isolated geographically, planters and other slaveholders had migrated
iinto Texas from eastern states to escape the fighting, and many brought
ienslaved people with them, increasing by the thousands the enslaved
ipopulation
iin the state at the end of the Civil War.[7] Although most lived in rural
iareas, more than 1,000 resided in Galveston or Houston by 1860, with several
ihundred in other large towns.[33] By 1865, there were an estimated 250,000
ienslaved people in Texas.[7][34]
i
iDespite the surrender of Confederate General-in-Chief Robert E. Lee at
iAppomattox Court House on April 9, 1865, the western Confederate Army of the
iTrans-Mississippi did not surrender until June 2.[7] On the morning of June
i19, 1865, Union Major General Gordon Granger arrived on the island of
iGalveston[35] to take command of the more than 2,000 federal troops recently
ilanded in the department of Texas to enforce the emancipation of its enslaved
ipopulation and oversee Reconstruction, nullifying all laws passed within
iTexas
iduring the war by Confederate lawmakers.[35][36] The order informed all
iTexans
ithat, in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United
iStates, all enslaved people were free:
i
iThe people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from
ithe Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an
iabsolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former
imasters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them
ibecomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to
iremain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed
ithat they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will
inot be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.[37]
i
iLongstanding urban legend places a historic reading of General Order No. 3 at
iAshton Villa; however, no historical evidence supports such claims.[38] There
iis no evidence that Granger or any of his troops proclaimed the Ordinance by
ireading it aloud. All indications are that copies of the Ordinance were
iposted
iin public places, including the Negro Church on Broadway, since renamed Reedy
iChapel A.M.E. Church.[39]
i
iOn June 21, 2014, the Galveston Historical Foundation and Texas Historical
iCommission erected a Juneteenth plaque where the Osterman Building once stood
isignifying the location of Major General Granger's Union Headquarters
ibelieved
ito be where he issued of his general orders.[40]
i
iAlthough this event commemorates the end of slavery, emancipation for the
iremaining enslaved in two Union border states, Delaware and Kentucky, would
inot come until December 6, 1865, when the Thirteenth Amendment was
iratified.[41][c][d] The freedom of formerly enslaved people in Texas was
igiven
istate law status in a series of Texas Supreme Court decisions between 1868
iand
i1874.[43]
i
iMajor General Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3 formally informing
iTexas residents that slavery had ended.
i
iGeneral Order No. 3, June 19, 1865
i
iFormerly enslaved people in Galveston rejoiced after General Order No. 3.[44]
iOne year later, on June 19, 1866, freedmen in Texas organized the first of
iwhat became annual commemorations of "Jubilee Day".[37] Early celebrations
iwere used as political rallies to give voting instructions to newly freed
iAfrican Americans.[45] Other independence observances occurred on January 1
ior
i4.[46]
i
iIn some cities, Black people were barred from using public parks because of
istate-sponsored segregation of facilities. Across parts of Texas, freed
ipeople
ipooled their funds to purchase land to hold their celebrations.[7][37] The
iday
iwas first celebrated in Austin in 1867 under the auspices of the Freedmen's
iBureau, and it had been listed on a "calendar of public events" by 1872.[41]
iThat year, Black leaders in Texas raised $1,000 for the purchase of 10 acres
i(4 ha) of land, today known as Houston's Emancipation Park, to celebrate
iJuneteenth.[47] The observation was soon drawing thousands of attendees
iacross
iTexas; in Limestone County, an estimated 30,000 Black people celebrated at
iBooker T. Washington Park, established in 1898 for Juneteenth
icelebrations.[41][9] The Black community began using the word Juneteenth for
iJubilee Day early in the 1890s.[34] The Current Issue, a Texas periodical,
iused the word as early as 1909,[48] and that year a book on San Antonio
iremarked, with condescension, on "June 'teenth'".[49]
i
iIn the early 20th century, economic and political forces led to a decline in
iJuneteenth celebrations. From 1890 to 1908, Texas and all former Confederate
istates passed new constitutions or amendments that effectively
idisenfranchised
iBlack people, excluding them from the political process. White-dominated
istate
ilegislatures passed Jim Crow laws imposing second-class status.[50] Gladys L.
iKnight writes the decline in celebration was in part because "upwardly mobile
iblacks ... were ashamed of their slave past and aspired to assimilate into
imainstream culture. Younger generations of blacks, becoming further removed
ifrom slavery were occupied with school ... and other pursuits." Others who
imigrated to the Northern United States could not take time off or simply
idropped the celebration.[9]
i
iThe Great Depression forced many Black people off farms and into the cities
ito find work, where they had difficulty taking the day off to celebrate. From
i1936 to 1951, the Texas State Fair served as a destination for celebrating
ithe
iholiday, contributing to its revival. In 1936, an estimated 150,000 to
i200,000
ipeople joined the holiday's celebration in Dallas. In 1938, Governor of Texas
iJames Allred issued a proclamation stating in part:[51]
i
iWhereas, the Negroes in the State of Texas observe June 19 as the official
iday for the celebration of Emancipation from slavery; and
i
iWhereas, June 19, 1865, was the date when General [Gordon] Granger, who had
icommand of the Military District of Texas, issued a proclamation notifying
ithe
iNegroes of Texas that they were free; and
i
iWhereas, since that time, Texas Negroes have observed this day with suitable
iholiday ceremony, except during such years when the day comes on a Sunday;
iwhen the Governor of the State is asked to proclaim the following day as the
iholiday for State observance by Negroes; and
i
iWhereas, June 19, 1938, this year falls on Sunday; NOW, THEREFORE, I, JAMES
iV. ALLRED, Governor of the State of Texas, do set aside and proclaim the day
iof June 20, 1938, as the date for observance of EMANCIPATION DAY
i
iin Texas, and do urge all members of the Negro race in Texas to observe the
iday in a manner appropriate to its importance to them.
i
iSeventy thousand people attended a "Juneteenth Jamboree" in 1951.[51] From
i1940 through 1970, in the second wave of the Great Migration, more than five
imillion Black people left Texas, Louisiana and other parts of the South for
ithe North and the West Coast. As historian Isabel Wilkerson writes, "The
ipeople from Texas took Juneteenth Day to Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, and
iother places they went."[52] In 1945, Juneteenth was introduced in San
iFrancisco by a migrant from Texas, Wesley Johnson.[53]
i
iDuring the 1950s and 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement focused the attention
iof African Americans on expanding freedom and integrating. As a result,
iobservations of the holiday declined again, though it was still celebrated in
iTexas.[45][46]

i
iJuneteenth soon saw a revival as Black people began tying their struggle to
ithat of ending slavery. In Atlanta, some campaigners for equality wore
iJuneteenth buttons. During the 1968 Poor People's Campaign to Washington, DC,
icalled by Rev. Ralph Abernathy, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
imade June 19 the "Solidarity Day of the Poor People’s Campaign".[41][53] In
ithe subsequent revival, large celebrations in Minneapolis and Milwaukee
iemerged, [13] as well as across the Eastern United States.[54] In 1974,
iHouston began holding large-scale celebrations again,[34] and Fort Worth,
iTexas, followed the next year. Around 30,000 people attended festivities at
iSycamore Park in Fort Worth the following year.[45] The 1978 Milwaukee
icelebration was described as drawing over 100,000 attendees.[54] In 1979, the
iTexas Legislature made the occasion a state holiday.[55] In the late 1980s,
ithere were major celebrations of Juneteenth in California, Wisconsin,
iIllinois, Georgia, and Washington, D.C.[34]
i
iIn 1979, Democratic State Representative Al Edwards of Houston successfully
isponsored legislation to make Juneteenth a paid Texas state holiday. The same
iyear, he hosted the inaugural Al Edwards prayer breakfast and commemorative
icelebration on the grounds of the 1859 home, Ashton Villa. As one of the few
iexisting buildings from the Civil War era and popular in local myth and
ilegend
ias the location of Major General Granger’s order, Edwards's annual
icelebration
iincludes a local historian dressed as the Union general[56] reading General
iOrder No. 3 from the second-story balcony of the home. The Emancipation
iProclamation is also read and speeches are made.[57][58] Representative Al
iEdwards died of natural causes April 29, 2020, at the age of 83,[59] but the
iannual prayer breakfast and commemorative celebration continued at Ashton
iVilla, with the late legislator's son Jason Edwards speaking in his father’s
iplace.[60][61]
i
iIn the late 1970s, when the Texas Legislature declared Juneteenth a "holiday
iof significance ... particularly to the blacks of Texas,"[46] it became the
ifirst state to establish Juneteenth as a state holiday.[62] The bill passed
ithrough the Texas Legislature in 1979 and was officially made a state holiday
ion January 1, 1980. Before 2000, three more U.S. states officially observed
ithe day, and over the next two decades it was recognized as an official
iobservance in all states, except South Dakota, until becoming a federal
iholiday.[4]
i
iSince the 1980s and 1990s, the holiday has been more widely celebrated among
iAfrican-American communities and has seen increasing mainstream attention in
ithe US.[9][63] In 1991, there was an exhibition by the Anacostia Community
iMuseum (part of the Smithsonian Institution) called "Juneteenth '91, Freedom
iRevisited."[13] In 1994, a group of community leaders gathered at Christian
iUnity Baptist Church in New Orleans to work for greater national celebration
iof Juneteenth.[9][63] Expatriates have celebrated it in cities abroad, such
ias
iParis.[17] Some US military bases in other countries sponsor celebrations, in
iaddition to those of private groups.[17][64] In 1999, Ralph Ellison's novel
iJuneteenth was published, increasing recognition of the holiday.[65] By 2006,
iat least 200 cities celebrated the day.[13]
i
iIn 1997, activist Ben Haith created the Juneteenth flag, which was further
irefined by illustrator Lisa Jeanne Graf. In 2000, the flag was first hoisted
iat the Roxbury Heritage State Park in Boston by Haith. The star at the center
irepresents Texas and the extension of freedom for all African Americans
ithroughout the whole nation. The burst around the star represents a nova and
ithe red curve represents a horizon, standing for a new era for African
iAmericans. The red, white, and blue colors represent the American flag, which
ishows that African Americans and their enslaved ancestors are Americans, and
ithe national belief in liberty and justice for all citizens.[66][67]
i
iThe holiday gained mainstream awareness outside African-American communities
ithrough depictions in entertainment media, such as episodes of TV series
iAtlanta (2016)[68] and Black-ish (2017),[69] the latter of which featured
imusical numbers about the holiday by Aloe Blacc, The Roots,[70] and Fonzworth
iBentley.[71][72] In 2018, Apple added Juneteenth to its calendars in iOS
iunder
iofficial U.S. holidays.[73] Some private companies have adopted Juneteenth as
ia paid day off for employees, while others have officially marked the day in
iother ways, such as a moment of silence.[74][75] In 2020, several American
icorporations and educational institutions, including Twitter, the National
iFootball League, Nike, began treating Juneteenth as a company holiday,
iproviding a paid day off to their workers,[76] and Google Calendar added
iJuneteenth to its U.S. Holidays calendar.[77] Also in 2020, a number of major
iuniversities formally recognized Juneteenth,[78][79] either as a "day of
ireflection" or as a university holiday with paid time off for faculty and
istaff.[79]
i
iThe 2020 mother-daughter film on the holiday's pageant culture, Miss
iJuneteenth, celebrates African-American women who are "determined to stand on
itheir own," while a resourceful mother is "getting past a sexist tendency in
iher community to keep women in their place."[80]
i
iIn 1996, the first federal legislation to recognize "Juneteenth Independence
iDay" was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, H.J. Res. 195,
isponsored by Barbara-Rose Collins (D-MI). In 1997, Congress recognized the
iday
ithrough Senate Joint Resolution 11 and House Joint Resolution 56. In 2013,
ithe
iU.S. Senate passed Senate Resolution 175, acknowledging Lula Briggs Galloway
i(late president of the National Association of Juneteenth Lineage), who
i"successfully worked to bring national recognition to Juneteenth Independence
iDay", and the continued leadership of the National Juneteenth Observance
iFoundation.[81]
i
iIn the 2000s and 2010s, activists continued a long process to push Congress
itowards official recognition of Juneteenth.[82] Organizations such as the
iNational Juneteenth Observance Foundation sought a Congressional designation
iof Juneteenth as a national day of observance.[7] By 2016, 45 states were
irecognizing the occasion.[55] Activist Opal Lee, often referred to as the
i"grandmother of Juneteenth",[83], campaigned for decades to make Juneteenth a
ifederal holiday, leading walks in many states to promote the idea.[84] In
i2016–17 at the age of 89, she led a symbolic walk from Fort Worth, Texas to
iWashington D.C. to advocate for the federal holiday.[55][85] When it was
iofficially made a federal holiday on June 17, 2021, she was standing beside
iPresident Joe Biden as he signed the bill.[84]
i
iJuneteenth became one of five date-specific federal holidays along with New
iYear's Day (January 1), Independence Day (July 4), Veterans Day (November
i11),
iand Christmas Day (December 25). Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday
isince Martin Luther King Jr. Day was declared a holiday in 1986.[86][87][88]
iJuneteenth also falls within the statutory Honor America Days period, which
ilasts for 21 days from Flag Day (June 14) to Independence Day (July 4).
i
i===== Legal observance =====
i
iTexas was the first state to recognize the date by enacted law, in 1980. By
i2002, eight states officially recognized Juneteenth[89] and four years later
i15 states recognized the holiday.[46] By 2008, just over half of the states
irecognized Juneteenth in some way.[90] By 2019, 47 states and the District of
iColumbia recognized Juneteenth,[91] although as of 2020 only Texas had
iadopted
ithe holiday as a paid holiday for state employees.[92]
i
iIn June 2019, Governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolf recognized Juneteenth as a
iholiday in the state.[93] In the yearlong aftermath of the murder of George
iFloyd that occurred on May 25, 2020, nine states designated Juneteenth a paid
iholiday,[94] including New York, Washington, and Virginia.[95] In 2020,
iMassachusetts Governor Charlie Baker issued a proclamation that the day would
ibe marked as "Juneteenth Independence Day". This followed the filing of bills
iby both the House and Senate to make Juneteenth a state holiday. Baker did
inot
icomment on these bills specifically but promised to grant the observance of
iJuneteenth greater importance.[96] On June 16, 2021, Illinois adopted a law
ichanging its ceremonial holiday to a paid state holiday.[97]
i
iSome cities and counties have also recognized Juneteenth through
iproclamation. In 2020, Juneteenth was formally recognized by New York City
i(as
ian annual official city holiday and public school holiday, starting in
i2021).[98][99] Cook County, Illinois, adopted an ordinance to make Juneteenth
ia paid county holiday.[100] The City and County of Honolulu recognizes it as
ian "annual day of honor and reflection",[101] and Portland, Oregon (as a day
iof remembrance and action and a paid holiday for city employees).[102]
i
iNorth Dakota approved recognition of Juneteenth as a state-recognized annual
iholiday on April 13, 2021,[103] with Hawaii becoming the 49th state to
irecognize the holiday on June 16, 2021.[e][104][105] On June 16, 2020 South
iDakota Governor Kristi Noem proclaimed that the following June 19, 2020 was
ito
ibe Juneteenth Day for that year only, spurning calls for it to be recognized
iannually, rather than just for 2020.[106] In February 2022, South Dakota
ibecame the last state to recognize Juneteenth as an annual state holiday or
iobservance.[107] Its law provided for following the federal law even before
iit
iwas official.[108] On May 2, 2022, Colorado Governor Jared Polis signed a
ibill
ichanging the state's ceremonial observance to a state holiday and it is now
ithe 11th state holiday in Colorado.[109]
i
iAs of May 30, 2023, 24 states and the District of Columbia have made
iJuneteenth a paid holiday for state employees, with the remainder maintaining
ia ceremonial observance (New Mexico's personnel board declared it a paid
iworker holiday, although it is not a statutory holiday in New Mexico):[110]
i
iJuneteenth is a federal holiday in the United States. For decades, activists
iand congress members (led by many African Americans) proposed legislation,
iadvocated for, and built support for state and national observances. During
ihis campaign for president in June 2020, Joe Biden publicly celebrated the
iholiday.[118] President Donald Trump, during his campaign for reelection,
iadded making the day a national holiday part of his "Platinum Plan for Black
iAmerica".[119] Spurred on by the advocates and the Congressional Black
iCaucus,
ion June 15, 2021, the Senate unanimously passed the Juneteenth National
iIndependence Day Act,[120] establishing Juneteenth as a federal holiday; it
isubsequently passed through the House of Representatives by a 415–14 vote on
iJune 16.[121][122] President Joe Biden signed the bill (Pub. L. 117–17 (text)
i(PDF))[123][124] on June 17, 2021, making Juneteenth the eleventh American
ifederal holiday and the first to obtain legal observance as a federal holiday
isince Martin Luther King Jr. Day was designated in 1983.[125][87][88]
iAccording to the bill, federal government employees will now get to take the
iday off every year on June 19, or should the date fall on a Saturday or
iSunday, they will get the Friday or Monday closest to the Saturday or Sunday
ion which the date falls.[126]
