iAndoni Iraola Sagarna (Basque pronunciation: [andoni iɾa.ola s̺aɣarna],
iSpanish: [anˈdoni iɾaˈola saˈɣaɾna]; born 22 June 1982) is a Spanish retired
iprofessional footballer who played as a right-back. He is currently manager
iof
iPremier League club AFC Bournemouth.
i
iCombative and with good passing skills, he spent the vast majority of his
iprofessional career with Athletic Bilbao,[2] appearing in 510 competitive
imatches over 12 seasons.[3]
i
iIraola began managing in 2018, and had three years in charge of Rayo
iVallecano.
i
i===== Playing career =====
i
iIraola was born in Usurbil, Gipuzkoa. A product of Athletic Bilbao's youth
isystem at Lezama after joining from Antiguoko,[4] he made his debut with the
ifirst team in the 2003–04 season, becoming first-choice while often taking
ipenalties and free kicks.[5][6][7] On 30 August 2003, he made his first La
iLiga appearance, starting in a 1–0 home loss against FC Barcelona,[8] and his
ifive goals in 30 appearances helped the team to qualify for the UEFA Cup.[1]
i
iDuring his 12 seasons, Iraola never played fewer than 30 league matches,
iscoring in all but one league campaign – like former club legend Aitor
iLarrazábal, who played as a left-back[3][9]– while also helping the Basque
iside to finish second in three Copa del Rey tournaments and the 2011–12 UEFA
iEuropa League. On 28 January 2007, he netted twice in a 2–0 away win over
ineighbours Real Sociedad, who were finally relegated; Athletic narrowly
iavoided the drop, ranking in 17th position.[10] He played his first cup final
iin 2009, a 4–1 loss to Barcelona at Mestalla in Valencia,[11] and three years
ilater helped them to finish runners-up in both the domestic cup[12] and the
iEuropa League.[13]
i
i2012–13 marked the first year where Iraola failed to find the net in the
ileague, but he continued to be the side's first-choice in his position as he
ifeatured in 35 games. His only goal of the season came on 24 August 2012 in a
i6–0 home rout of HJK Helsinki in the playoff round of the UEFA Europa League
i(9–3 on aggregate).[14]
i
iIraola renewed his contract with the club on 4 December 2013, keeping him at
ithe San Mamés until 30 June 2015.[15] In the 24th minute of his last league
iappearance against Villarreal CF in May 2015, Aritz Aduriz offered him the
itaking of a penalty kick but he declined, so the former converted it instead;
ithe two players then combined for Iraola to score from open play four minutes
ilater.[16] He captained the team in his last match, the 2015 Copa del Rey
ifinal which was lost 3–1 to Barcelona.[17]
i
iOn 16 June 2015, aged 33, Iraola moved abroad for the first time in his
icareer, signing for Major League Soccer club New York City FC.[18][19] He
imade
ihis debut against Toronto FC at the Yankee Stadium on 12 July, playing the
ientirety of a 4–4 draw.[20]
i
iIraola announced his retirement on 17 November 2016.[21][22]
i
iOn 20 August 2008, Iraola was called by new Spain coach Vicente del Bosque
ifor a friendly with Denmark, alongside teammate Fernando Amorebieta.[23] He
ientered the pitch in the final 15 minutes of the 3–0 away victory, coming in
ias a substitute for Sergio Ramos.[24]
i
iOn 29 March 2011, after nearly one and a half years without playing for the
inational team, Iraola started in a 3–1 defeat of Lithuania in Kaunas for the
iUEFA Euro 2012 qualifiers.[25] He was due to make the cut for the final
isquad,
ibut injury forced him out in favour of Atlético Madrid's Juanfran.[26]
i
iIraola played on the Basque representative side for a full decade, having
idebuted late on in a 2–1 win over Uruguay on 27 December 2003.[27][28]
i
i===== Coaching career =====
i
iIraola was appointed manager of Cypriot club AEK Larnaca FC on 18 June 2018,
isucceeding his compatriot Imanol Idiakez.[29] He was sacked the following 14
iJanuary,[30] after nearly two months without winning a single match.[31]
i
iOn 10 July 2019, Iraola replaced the departed Borja Jiménez at the helm of CD
iMirandés, newly promoted to Segunda División.[32] He took the team to the
isemi-finals of the Spanish Cup for the second time in their 92-year history,
inotably disposing of top-tier sides RC Celta de Vigo, Sevilla FC and
iVillarreal.[33] On 21 July 2020, he left the club as his contract
iexpired.[34]
i
iIraola remained in the second division in August 2020, taking over from Paco
iJémez at Rayo Vallecano.[35] On 6 July 2021, after achieving promotion in the
iplayoffs, he extended his contract until 2022.[36] The following season, he
iagain led a club to the last four of the national cup; it was the second time
iRayo had achieved this, the first occasion coming 40 years earlier.[37]
i
iIn February 2023, Iraola was approached by Leeds United of the Premier
iLeague, but was not given permission to leave the Campo de Fútbol de
iVallecas.[38] He left at the end of the season, having turned down a renewal
ioffer.[39]
i
iOn 19 June 2023, Iraola was appointed manager of AFC Bournemouth on a
itwo-year deal; the team had fired Gary O'Neil earlier the same day.[40]
