idementia," she wrote over a tearful photo of herself. "He really acts like he
ihates and does not know his children frequently."
i
iAoki described how Russell used to be "the best dad ever."
i
i"Prior to his media issues he was really the best dad ever and a great co
iparent. He and my mom were best friends," she wrote. "We all defended him
iagainst anything, and then he suddenly turned on ANYONE who will let him lash
iout."
i
i"It's a really just terrifying change to watch,” she wrote.
