iA TikToker has named the Surrey area that is the "Mecca for dogging" in a
ihilarious tongue-in-cheek viral video. Phil Carr took a tour of some of the
icounty's 70-plus sites that have become synonymous with an outdoor "meet and
igreet".
i
iIn the nearly four-minute clip, with humourous barking sounds every time the
iword "dogging" is said, "the nation's favourite county" is described as "the
iepicentre" for the public sex act - and Phil gave a few thoughts as to why.
iTaking a tour during the school holidays in the hopes of "not bumping into
idoggers" as "my online reputation and my marriage are both hanging on by
itheir
ifingertips", he said: "Well, the county has more woodland than any other in
ithe country, and it's all common land, which means lots of secluded car parks
isurrounded by trees to escape into.
i
i"But the second thing is Surrey is in the middle of the south-east, so it's
iwithin a short drive of millions and millions of people in London and the
iother Home Counties. And the third reason is we are Surrey if we choose to do
isomething we are the best at it."

i
iHotspots in the tour include some toilets in Dorking where Phil once bumped
iinto two men "having a brief physical relationship", and a little alleyway
inext to his former primary school. But there was one area that was described
ias the "Mecca for dogging", right next to the A3 and an RHS garden.
i
iPhil said: "I'm now at a place called Wisley Common, this is the famous one
ithat most people in the south-east would have heard of. It's a Mecca for
idogging and has been for decades. Absolutely everything goes on here...
ianything you could possibly imagine.
i
i"But what I wasn't banking on would be how active it is during a weekday
iduring the school holidays. There are way too many people loitering in the
icar
iparks in the woods for my liking."
i
iPhil then decides to go elsewhere to explain the legal status of the act
ibefore the camera moves to the next clip where he "has got a follower" as he
idecides to swiftly head back to the car. The viral clip has had more than
i51,000 views on Facebook and an incredible 380,000-plus on TikTok, with
inearly
i1,000 comments across both social media platforms.
