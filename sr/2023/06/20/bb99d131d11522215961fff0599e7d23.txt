i===== 'Difficult situation' in Ukraine's east as Russia deploys more troops
ito frontline, minister says =====
i
iUkraine’s deputy defence minister has described the situation in the east of
ithe country as “difficult”, saying that Russia has not given up its ambition
ito occupy the whole of the Donbas, and that is where it is concentrating its
ioffensive forces.
i
iIn a post on Telegram, Hanna Maliar wrote:
i
iThe situation in the east is now difficult. The enemy has raised its forces
iand is conducting an active offensive in the Lyman and Kupyan directions,
itrying to seize the initiative from us. High activity of enemy shelling is
irecorded. Intense battles continue.
i
iThe enemy does not abandon his plans to reach the borders of Donetsk and
iLuhansk regions. Currently, this is the enemy’s main offensive line.
iTherefore, it has concentrated a significant number of units in the east, in
iparticular the airborne assault units.
i
iOur troops act courageously in the face of the enemy’s superiority in forces
iand means, and do not allow the enemy to advance.
i
i===== Closing summary =====
i
iThe time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s
imain news:
i
iUkraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said that Russia had
iconcentrated a significant number of units in the east, including air assault
itroops, but that Ukrainian forces were preventing their advance. She
idescribed
ithe situation in the east of the country as “difficult”.
i
iThe British government announced plans to tighten its sanctions policy
iagainst Russia, including introducing legislation to keep assets frozen until
iMoscow has agreed to pay compensation to Ukraine. The new measures will
irequire any individual who has been designated under the sanctions to
idisclose
iassets held in Britain.
i
iIn a phone call on Monday, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, told the
iUkrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that it was clear the Ukrainian
icounteroffensive was “making good progress”, Downing Street said.
i
iNato leaders will not issue an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at
ia summit in Vilnius in mid-July, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general,
iconfirmed on Monday.
i
iThe Kremlin reportedly said on Monday that Russia’s decision to decline UN
ihelp in areas of Russian-held Ukraine flooded by the Kakhovka dam breach was
imotivated by security concerns and “other nuances”.
i
iA special Swedish parliamentary defence committee, which is supported by
isecurity experts, said the country’s defence must adapt to focus on the
ithreat
iposed by Russia, and that a military attack could not be ruled out.
i
iIn Russia, seven people, including a child, were said by local governors to
ihave been wounded in drone attacks in the Belgorod region.
i
iThe Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, has announced that the
icapture of the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern part of Zaporizhzhia,
ibrought the tally of liberated settlements up to eight, with 113 sq km of
iterritory said to have been seized from the occupying forces.
i
iFrance, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia and Hungary signed a letter of intent for
ithe joint purchase of Mistral air defence systems, a source told Reuters.
i
iThe source said the letter was signed at the start of a defence ministers’
imeeting in Paris aimed at coordinating European efforts to enhance air
idefence
icapabilities across the continent after Russia invaded Ukraine.
i
iGermany’s armed forces only have about 20,000 high explosive artillery shells
ileft, the magazine Der Spiegel reported on Monday, citing confidential
idefence
iministry papers.
i
iCountries like Germany have rushed to send supplies of 155m artillery rounds
iused by howitzers to Ukraine after its invasion by Russia last February,
irunning down stocks for their own defence.
i
iGermany’s military needs to build up an inventory of 230,000 shells by 2031
ito comply with Nato goals to have enough artillery to withstand 30 days of
iintensive combat, Reuters cited Der Spiegel as reporting.
i
iThe ministry aims to present the budget committee with nine contracts for the
iaccelerated purchase of artillery and tank ammunition in coming months, Der
iSpiegel wrote.
i
iDidier Reynders, the European commissioner for justice, has told the Kyiv
iIndependent that the EU and its partners want to bring all perpetrators of
iinternational crimes to justice.
i
i“Not only war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but also the
icrime of aggression,” he said, adding that his team was considering what an
iinternational trial against Russian crimes in Ukraine may look like.
i
iRussia has committed wide-ranging war crimes in Ukraine such as wilful
ikillings and torture, a UN mandated investigative body said in March.
i
iThe alleged crimes, including the deportation of children, were detailed in a
ireport by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine,
iwhich said some acts may amount to crimes against humanity.
i
iOn Monday, Alexei Navalny’s team announced the launch of a campaign to deter
iRussians from supporting the war in Ukraine, AFP reports.
i
iIn a post online, Navalny’s team said it was planning a “long, stubborn and
iexhaustive but fundamentally important campaign where we will turn people
iagainst the war”.
i
i“Against the dead-end that Putin crazily and dumbly put us in on 24 February
i2022,” it said, referring to the day Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine.
iIt said it planned to fundamentally change Russian public opinion within
imonths.
i
iRussia has introduced strict laws banning criticism of its army’s actions in
iUkraine. Organisations and lawyers that have campaigned for Russians critical
iof the offensive have faced increasing pressure.
i
iOn Monday, Russian state media reported that Agora, a leading human rights
igroup that provides legal help in political cases, was labelled as
i“undesirable”.
i
iYou can read the full story (which relates to the blog post at 16:40) here:
i
iAn EU report will this week say that Ukraine has met two out of seven
iconditions to start membership negotiations, two EU sources said.
i
iIn a highly symbolic move, the EU granted Ukraine formal membership candidate
istatus a year ago – four months after Russia attacked the country amid its
iefforts to pursue integration with the west.
i
iBut the EU set seven conditions – including on judicial reform and curbing
iendemic corruption – to launch accession negotiations.
i
iUkraine has called for talks to start this year. The executive European
iCommission’s report is a milestone in that process.
i
iTwo senior EU officials who were briefed on the report, which has not been
imade public, have now said that Ukraine met two of the criteria, Reuters
ireports. One of the officials said these related to judicial reform and media
ilaw.
i
iRussian troops hit the Beryslav district in the southern Kherson region with
iartillery on Monday, injuring three civilians, the regional administration
iwrote on Telegram, according to the Kyiv Independent.
i
iAt least five residential buildings, two private residences and an
iadministrative building were said to have been damaged in the attack.
i
iThese claims could not be immediately independently verified.
i
iRussian politician Alexei Navalny announced the start of a new mass campaign
iagainst Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine on Monday as he began his
ilatest
itrial in prison, facing a potential sentence of several more decades behind
ibars.
i
iReuters reports:
i
iNavalny, 47, is already serving sentences totalling 11½ years, and is now
ifacing an array of charges linked to alleged “extremist” activity. Acquittals
iof opposition figures are practically unheard of in Russia.
i
iJournalists who had travelled to the penal colony where Navalny is imprisoned
iin Melekhovo, about 145 miles east of Moscow, were barred from the courtroom
ibut could initially follow proceedings by video from a room nearby, though
ithe
isound was barely audible.
i
iNavalny, looking thin with cropped hair and dressed in a black prison
iuniform, stood and spoke loudly for three minutes.
i
iHe unsuccessfully demanded access to the courtroom for his elderly parents,
iand contested the authority of the judge from Moscow to try him in a prison
ifar from the capital.
i
iBut the feed was later cut, and a court spokesperson said further proceedings
iwould take place behind closed doors … Navalny’s supporters accuse Moscow of
itrying to break him in jail, where he has had long spells in solitary
iconfinement, to silence his criticism of Putin.
i
iThe Kremlin says his case is purely a judicial matter. “We are not following
ithis trial,” Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters.
i
iUkraine is seeking up to $40bn (£31.2bn) to fund the first part of a “Green
iMarshall plan” to rebuild its economy, including developing a coal-free steel
iindustry, a senior Ukrainian official said before an international summit.
i
iPoliticians and financiers will discuss short-term funding issues and look at
ilong-term reconstruction efforts at the two-day meeting, starting in London
ion
iWednesday and co-hosted by Ukraine and Britain, Reuters reports.
i
iIt is expected to launch a “war risk” insurance scheme to cover companies
ithat begin investing in Ukraine again.
i
iRussia has deployed more forces to Ukraine’s eastern frontline in an effort
ito advance toward Lyman and Kupiansk and seize the initiative, the Ukrainian
ideputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, was mentioned by the Kyiv Independent
ias reportedly saying.
i
i===== Summary of the day so far... =====
i
iThe UK is introducing new laws that will allow ministers to maintain Russian
isanctions until compensation is paid to Ukraine, thus introducing a way for
ifrozen Russian assets to be donated to Ukrainian reconstruction.
i
iRishi Sunak told Volodymyr Zelenskiy that it was clear the Ukrainian
icounteroffensive was “making good progress” when the two leaders spoke on
iMonday morning.
i
iNato leaders will not issue an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at
ia summit in Vilnius in mid-July, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general,
iconfirmed on Monday.

iThe Kremlin said on Monday that Russia’s decision to decline UN help in areas
iof Russian-held Ukraine flooded by the Kakhovka dam breach was motivated by
isecurity concerns and “other nuances”, Reuters reported.
i
iA special Swedish parliamentary defence committee has said the Nordic
icountry’s defence must focus on the threat posed by Russia, and that a
imilitary attack could not be ruled out.
i
iIn Russia, seven people, including a child, were said by local governors to
ihave been wounded in drone attacks in the Belgorod region.
i
iUkraine has recaptured the village of Piatykhatky, in the southern
iZaporizhzhia region, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, has
iconfirmed.
i
iVolodymyr Zelenskiy has just tweeted about his phone call with Ajay Banga,
ithe president of the World Bank, on Monday.
i
iUkraine’s president said he thanked the World Bank for its “unwavering
isupport” shown to his country since Russia invaded last February, noting its
i“rapid response” to the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam.
i
iHe added:
i
iI invited the World Bank to reopen its representative office in Ukraine and
iemphasised that we are interested in cooperation during the post-war
itransformation of Ukraine, in particular, in overcoming corruption and
ireducing the share of cash in the Ukrainian economy.
i
iHad a phone call with @WorldBank President Ajay Banga. Thanked for the World
iBank's unwavering support since the first days of Russia's full-scale
iaggression. We discussed further development of cooperation, in particular,
imobilization of international support. I noted the rapid…
i
iRussia’s deputy foreign minister has said that even if a deal allowing
ishipments of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea ends, Russia’s agreement with
ithe UN to ease its own exports will stay in force, the Russian state news
iagency RIA reported on Monday.
i
iMoscow has repeatedly said it sees little chance of agreeing an extension of
ithe Black Sea Grain Initiative beyond 18 July, because it says western
isanctions are thwarting its own UN-backed attempts to export grain and
ifertiliser.
i
iReuters reports that when asked by RIA if the collapse of the grain deal
iwould invalidate its memorandum with the UN, Alexander Grushko, the deputy
iforeign minister, said: “No, it will not.”
i
iAfter invading Ukraine, a leading grain exporter, last year, Russia blockaded
iits Black Sea ports, contributing to a global surge in food prices.
i
iTo help persuade Russia to allow grain ships safe passage under the Black Sea
iinitiative last July, a separate three-year agreement was also struck in
iwhich
ithe UN agreed to help Russia with its food and fertiliser exports.
i
iBut Moscow has repeatedly complained that western sanctions imposed in
iresponse to the invasion continue to create financial, logistical and
iinsurance obstacles to its shipments.
