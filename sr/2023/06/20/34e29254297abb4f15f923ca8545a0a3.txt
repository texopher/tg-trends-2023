iChief Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu GCFR (born 29 March 1952) is a Nigerian
ipolitician who is the 16th and current president of Nigeria.[1] He was the
igovernor of Lagos State from 1999 to 2007; and senator for Lagos West in the
iThird Republic.
i
iTinubu spent his early life in southwestern Nigeria and later moved to the
iUnited States where he studied Accounting at Chicago State University. He
ireturned to Nigeria in the early 1990s and was employed by Mobil Nigeria as
ian
iaccountant, before entering politics as a Lagos West senatorial candidate in
i1992 under the banner of the Social Democratic Party. After dictator Sani
iAbacha dissolved the Senate in 1993, Tinubu became an activist campaigning
ifor
ithe return of democracy as a part of the National Democratic Coalition
imovement.
i
iIn the first post-transition Lagos State gubernatorial election, Tinubu won
iby a wide margin as a member of the Alliance for Democracy. Four years later,
ihe won re-election to a second term. After leaving office in 2007, he played
ia
ikey role in the formation of the All Progressives Congress in 2013. In 2023,
ihe was elected president of Nigeria.
i
i===== Background =====
i
iTinubu was born in Lagos into the merchant family of Abibatu Mogaji, the
iÌyál'ọ́jà of Lagos. He is generally accepted in reliable sources to have been
iborn in 1952;[2] this year of birth is sometimes disputed by political
iopponents, who argue that he is much older. Some reliable sources note that
ihis age has not been verified.[3][4]
i
iTinubu attended St. John's Primary School, Aroloya, Lagos before proceeding
ito Children Home School in Ibadan.[5] He completed undergraduate studies in
ithe United States, first at Richard J. Daley College in Chicago and then at
iChicago State University. He graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science
idegree in Accounting.[6]
i
iTinubu worked for the American companies Arthur Andersen, Deloitte and GTE
iServices Corporation.[7] After returning to Nigeria in 1983, he joined Mobil
iOil Nigeria, and later became a company executive.[8]
i
i===== Early political career =====
i
iTinubu's political career began in 1991,[9] when he joined the Social
iDemocratic Party.
i
iMain article: Third Nigerian Republic
i
iIn 1992, he was elected to the Senate, representing the Lagos West
iconstituency in the short-lived Nigerian Third Republic.[10]
i
iAfter the results of the 12 June 1993 presidential elections were annulled,
iTinubu became a founding member of the pro-democracy National Democratic
iCoalition, a group which mobilized support for the restoration of democracy
iand recognition of Moshood Abiola as winner of the 12 June election.
i
iMain articles: National Democratic Coalition (Nigeria) and Military
idictatorship in Nigeria
i
iFollowing the seizure of power as military head of state of General Sani
iAbacha,[11] he went into exile in 1994 and returned to the country in 1998
iafter the death of the military dictator, which ushered in the transition to
ithe Fourth Nigerian Republic.[12]
i
iIn the run-up to the 1999 elections, Bola Tinubu was a protégé of Alliance
ifor Democracy (AD) leaders Abraham Adesanya and Ayo Adebanjo.[13] He went on
ito win the AD primaries for the Lagos State governorship elections in
idefeating Funsho Williams and Wahab Dosunmu, a former Minister of Works and
iHousing.[14] In January 1999, he stood for the position of Governor of Lagos
iState on the AD ticket and was elected governor.[15]
i
iDuring his 8 years in government, Tinibu initiated new road construction,
irequired to meet the needs of the fast-growing population of the state.[16]
i
iTinubu, alongside a new deputy governor, Femi Pedro, won re-election into
ioffice as governor in April 2003. All other states in the South West fell to
ithe People's Democratic Party in those elections.[17] He was involved in a
istruggle with the Olusegun Obasanjo-controlled federal government over
iwhether
iLagos State had the right to create new Local Council Development Areas
i(LCDAs) to meet the needs of its large population. The controversy led to the
ifederal government seizing funds meant for local councils in the state.[18]
iDuring the latter part of his term in office, he was engaged in continuous
iclashes with PDP powers such as Adeseye Ogunlewe, a former Lagos State
isenator
iwho had become minister of works, and Bode George, the southwest chairman of
ithe PDP.[19]
i
iIn 2006, Tinubu attempted to persuade the then-vice president of Nigeria
iAtiku Abubakar to become the head of his party, the Action Congress (AC).
iAbubakar who was a member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP), had
irecently
ifallen out with President Olusegun Obasanjo over Abubakar's ambition to
isucceed Obasanjo as president. Tinubu offered Abubakar the chance to switch
iparties and join the AC, offering him the his party's presidential candidacy,
iwith the condition that he, Tinubu, would be Atiku Abubakar's running mate.
iAtiku declined the proposition and, having switched to the AC, chose a
irunning
imate from the South East, Senator Ben Obi. Although Atiku ran for office on
iTinubu's platform in the election, the PDP still won, in a landslide.[20]
i
iRelations between Tinubu and deputy governor Femi Pedro became increasingly
itense after Pedro declared his intention to run for the gubernatorial
ielections. Pedro competed to become the AC candidate for governor in the 2007
ielections, but withdrew his name on the eve of the party nomination. He
idefected to the Labour Party while still keeping his position as deputy
igovernor.[21] Tinubu's tenure as Lagos State Governor ended on 29 May 2007,
iwhen his successor Babatunde Fashola of the Action Congress took
ioffice.[22][23]
i
i===== Pre-presidency (2007–2023) =====
i
iIn 2009, following the landslide victory of the People's Democratic Party
i(PDP) in the April 2007 elections, Tinubu became involved in negotiations to
ibring together the fragmented opposition parties into a "mega-party" capable
iof challenging the then ruling PDP.[24] In March 2009, there were reports
ithat
ia plot had been identified to assassinate Tinubu.[25] In February 2013,
iTinubu
iwas among several politicians who created a "mega opposition" party with the
imerger of Nigeria's three biggest opposition parties – the Action Congress of
iNigeria (ACN), the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), the All Nigeria
iPeoples Party (ANPP), a faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA)
iand the new PDP (nPDP), a faction of the then ruling People's Democratic
iParty[26] – into the All Progressives Congress (APC).[27]
i
iIn 2014, Tinubu supported former military head of state General Muhammadu
iBuhari, leader of the CPC faction of the APC – who commanded widespread
ifollowing in Northern Nigeria, and had previously contested in the 2003, 2007
iand 2011 presidential elections as the CPC presidential candidate.[28] Tinubu
iinitially wanted to become Buhari's vice presidential candidate but later
iconceded for Yemi Osibanjo, his ally and former commissioner of justice.[29]
iIn 2015, Buhari rode the APC to victory, ending the 16-year rule of the PDP,
iand marking the first time an incumbent Nigerian president lost to an
iopposition candidate.[30]
i
iTinubu went on to play an important role in the Buhari administration,
isupporting government policies and holding onto the internal party reins, in
ilieu of his long-held rumored presidential aspiration.[31] In 2019, he
isupported Buhari's re-election campaign defeating the PDP candidate Atiku
iAbubakar. In 2020, following an internal party crisis which led to the
iremoval
iof Tinubu ally and party chairman Adams Oshiomole, it is believed the move
iwas
ito scuttle Tinubu's presidential prospects ahead of 2023.[32]
i
iOn 10 January 2022, Tinubu made his formal announcement of candidacy for
ipresident.[33][34][35]
i
iOn 8 June 2022, Tinubu won the party convention vote of the ruling APC,
iscoring 1,271, to defeat Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Rotimi Amaechi who
iscored 235 and 316 respectively.[36]
i
iOn 1 March 2023, INEC declared Tinubu winner of the 2023 presidential
ielection.[37] He was declared president-elect after he polled 8,794,726 votes
ito defeat his opponents.[38] His runner-up Atiku Abubakar of the opposition
iPeople's Democratic Party (PDP) polled 6,984,520 votes. Labour Party's Peter
iObi had 6,101,533 votes to come third.[39]
i
i===== Presidency (2023–present) =====
i
iTinubu constitutionally began his presidency on 29 May 2023. He was sworn in
ias President of Nigeria by the Chief Justice of Nigeria Olukayode Ariwoola at
i10:41 AM (WAT) at an inauguration ceremony held in Eagle Square in Abuja.[40]
iHis government having cleared the legal hurdles of the opposition following
ithe March election is generally accepted unopposed and has international
ilegitimacy.[41] Several heads of state and government attended the
iswearing-in
iceremony.[42] Tinubu was conferred with the highest national honour of the
iGrand Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic by his predecessor
iMuhammadu Buhari, and his Vice President Kashim Shettima with the second
ihighest honor of the Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger on 25 May
i2023.[43]
i
i===== Ideology and public image =====
i
iTinubu has throughout his political career espoused a comprehensive political
iand economic platform. Tinubu's ideal of progressivism include the values of
iegalitarianism, social justice, liberty, and the recognition of fundamental
irights. He views the state as a positive advocate for the public welfare and
iits intervention in Nigerian society as necessary to ensure equality,
ijustice,
iand social harmony.[44] This ideal is not so far removed from his activism of
idemocracy during the military dictatorship in Nigeria.[45] His presidency is
ideftly expected to be a politico-ideological departure from Buharism, albiet,
imost international economists are yet to ascertain the nature of this
ideparture in economic terms.[46][47] The World Bank and IMF have pointed out
ithe poignancy of the moment for the incoming government to establish
imacro-structural adjustments on the scale of the late 1980s reform to
ire-herald the Nigerian economy amidst a global slowdown.[48]
i
iMain article: The Lion of Bourdillon
i
iTinubu has been widely perceived as the "Godfather of Lagos".[49] His role in
ipulling the strings of the mega city-state was exposed in The Lion of
iBourdillon, a 2015 documentary film highlighting Tinubu's political and
ifinancial grip on the city-state. Tinubu filed a ₦150 billion libel suit
iagainst the producers, Africa Independent Television (AIT).[50] The
idocumentary ceased airing on 6 March 2015. He has attempted to strongarm the
ipolitical process, including in December 2009, when it was reported that
iFashola and Tinubu had fallen out over the issue of Fashola's re-election as
iGovernor of Lagos in 2011, with Tinubu preferring the commissioner for
ienvironment, Muiz Banire.[51] A similar conflict took place in 2015 over
iFashola's successor, Akinwunmi Ambode, pitting Fashola against Tinubu, who
ithrew his full weight behind Ambode.[52] Ambode succeeded Fashola, was ousted
iby Tinubu and replaced by incumbent Babajide Sanwo-Olu.[53][54]
i
iIn 1993, his assets were frozen by the United States government as a result
iof a court case asserting that the American government had "probable cause"
ito
ibelieve Tinubu's American bank accounts held the proceeds of heroin dealing.
iHe settled with the U.S. government and forfeited about $460,000 later that
iyear. Court documents and later reporting on the case suggested he worked in
ileague with two Chicago heroin dealers.[55][56][57]
i
iIn April 2007, after the general elections, but before the governor-elect
iBabatunde Fashola had taken office, the Federal Government brought Tinubu
ibefore the Code of Conduct Bureau for trial over the alleged illegal
ioperation
iof 16 separate foreign accounts.[58]
i
iIn January 2009, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission cleared Tinubu
iand governors James Ibori of Delta State and Obong Victor Attah of Akwa Ibom
iState of charges of conspiracy, money laundering, abuse of office and
iofficial
icorruption in relation to a sale of Vmobile network shares in 2004.[59] In
iSeptember 2009, there were reports that the British Metropolitan Police were
iinvestigating a transaction in which the Lagos State government made an
iinvestment in Econet (now Airtel). Tinubu said the transaction was
istraightforward and profitable to the state, with no intermediaries
iinvolved.[60] The Federal Government rejected a request by Britain to release
ievidence needed for further investigation and prosecution of the three
iNigerian ex-governors in a London court.[61]
i
iDuring the 2019 election, a bullion van was seen entering Tinubu's residence
ion Bourdillion Road in Ikoyi, which caused him to later exclaim: "I keep
imoney
ianywhere I want."[62]
i
i===== Personal life =====
i
iTinubu married Oluremi Tinubu, who is a former senator representing the Lagos
iCentral senatorial district, in 1987. They have 3 children, Zainab Abisola
iTinubu, Habibat Tinubu and Olayinka Tinubu.[63][64] He fathered 3 children
ifrom previous relationships, Kazeem Olajide Tinubu (12 October 1974 – 31
iOctober 2017), Folashade Tinubu (born 17 June 1976) and Oluwaseyi Tinubu
i(born
i13 October 1985), whose mother is rumoured to be the former air hostess and
iprophetess Bunmi Oshonike.[65][66]
i
iTinubu's mother, Abibatu Mogaji, died on 15 June 2013 at the age of 96.[67]
iOn 31 October 2017, his son, Jide Tinubu, died in London.[68] Tinubu is a
iMuslim.[69]
