i
iFollowing the announcement of Ian Foster‚Äôs 36-man New Zealand squad for the
iRugby Championship, Planet Rugby picks out the winners and losers.
i
iWinners
i
iCongratulations to the five newbies, Cam Roigard, Dallas McLeod, Emoni
iNarawa, Samipeni Finau and Tamaiti Williams, who have all made the All Blacks
isquad. They are thoroughly deserved call-ups after stunning Super Rugby
icampaigns.
i
iTwo of them, Narawa and Finau, come from the Chiefs after their impressive
i2023, where they finished at the Super Rugby Pacific summit and reached the
ifinal. The former is a lightning-quick wing, who has torn opponents to
ishreds,
iwhile the latter is a big-hitting back-row that has shone for the league
ileaders.
i
iThe other three are also interesting inclusions. Roigard has taken his chance
isuperbly in the absence of TJ Perenara and, with New Zealand struggling to
ifind their back-up to Aaron Smith, the Hurricanes man could well find himself
iin that 23 heading into the World Cup.
i
iMcLeod and Williams have equally had breakthroughs in 2023, this time at the
iCrusaders, with the former a strong and skilful utility back, who can play
ieither at centre or on the wing. His team-mate is similarly versatile and is
ione of the few props that can feature at either loosehead or tighthead,
iseemingly with equal aplomb.
i
iHis captaincy and the battle between him and Dalton Papalii for the openside
ijersey has been the big talking point over the past year. Particularly with
ithe 31-year-old suffering with injuries and a lack of form since the previous
iWorld Cup, that spot has come under increasing pressure, but Foster has
ialways
ikept faith in the skipper.
i
iAnd on the basis of this year, he is probably right to with Cane excelling in
ia superb Chiefs outfit. It is interesting that the head coach decided to
isingle him out for praise in his press release, saying: ‚ÄúSam has proven
ihimself as a great leader of our team despite having had a disrupted couple
iof
iseasons leading into this one. We have total belief that he is the right man
ito lead us.‚Äù A message to his detractors, perhaps?
i
iAll in all, he‚Äôs had a decent season for the Blues, but there are back three
iplayers that have been far better than him. Equally, it is concerning that
ihis
ibasics don‚Äôt hold up in big games, as evidenced by the Aucklanders‚Äô heavy
idefeat to the Crusaders in the Super Rugby Pacific semi-final.
i
iClarke isn‚Äôt good enough under the high ball, doesn‚Äôt work hard enough to get
iinvolved in the game, and his defence is flaky. Despite being a thrill to
iwatch with ball in hand, those weaknesses will be exposed by the best at the
ivery highest level.
i
iSpeaking of the form of wingers, Leicester Fainga‚Äôanuku has been outstanding
ifor the Crusaders this season. His move to Toulon following the World Cup
icould have derailed his All Blacks ambitions, but the 23-year-old is playing
itoo well to ignore. Unlike Clarke, there is no doubting his work ethic off
ithe
iball, and he could well be a key player heading into the global tournament.

i
iThe same could also be said of Braydon Ennor, who has battled back from
iinjury to be included in the New Zealand squad. Ennor ruptured his ACL in
i2020
iand that evidently affected his form over the next couple of years, but in
i2023 he has gradually improved over the course of the season. The 25-year-old
ihas timed his run well, playing a key role for Scott Robertson‚Äôs men at the
iend of the campaign.
i
iLosers
i
iWe can‚Äôt quite believe it. He was one uncapped player we had inked into the
isquad for the Rugby Championship but, for whatever reason, Foster has never
iquite rated the Chiefs star. Stevenson has always been a standout for the
iWaikato outfit, but we previously understood why others were seen to be ahead
iof him in the pecking order. However, the 26-year-old has arguably been the
ifranchise‚Äôs best player in 2023, perhaps even eclipsing the brilliant Damian
iMcKenzie this year.
i
iThere is so much to admire about his game, not just his pace, balance and
ifootwork, but also the fundamentals. Stevenson is such a smart rugby player
iwho pretty much always takes the right decisions, so it is staggering that
ithe
italented back has missed out. The full-back or wing has been added as injury
icover for Mark Telea, but the fact that he hasn‚Äôt made the 36 is hugely
isurprising.
i
iThe decline of Hoskins Sotutu has been stark, with the number eight failing
ito make either the All Blacks or All Blacks XV squads. Sotutu is a massive
italent but, when it has come to doing it at the highest level, he has
istruggled to make an impact. That was the case in the Blues‚Äô Super Rugby
isemi-final defeat to the Crusaders, where he was physically overwhelmed by
ithe
ihosts.
i
iAkira Ioane is another player to miss out, although he did just enough to be
iincluded in the second string. The final member of that Blues back-row is
iPapalii, who does make it into the 36 and will be in and around the squad.
iHowever, the selection of Cane as captain is a big blow to his chances of
istarting ‚Äì and perhaps being in the 23 ‚Äì but the openside didn‚Äôt help himself
iwith his display against the ‚ÄòSaders.
i
iAaron Smith remains the number one half-back, and Roigard is the in-form
iplayer, which left one more place. Finlay Christie, Brad Weber and Folau
iFakatava were the individuals competing for that slot, and it was the Blues
iman who got the nod.

i
iWeber and Fakatava therefore missed out. The latter was not surprising, given
ithat he plays second fiddle to Smith at the Highlanders and did not do enough
iwhen he got on the field, but the former has enjoyed another fine campaign
iwith the Chiefs. Fakatava still has time on his side and could well play a
ikey
ipart for the All Blacks after the World Cup, but that may be it for Weber,
iwho
ileaves for the Top 14 following the global tournament.
i
iIt is a remarkably strong squad, especially when you consider who weren‚Äôt in
icontention due to injury. Ethan Blackadder, David Havili, Joe Moody, Quinn
iTupaea, Sevu Reece and Perenara were among those to miss out, all players
ithat
ioffer plenty if fit.
i
iIt is particularly cruel on Blackadder, someone that has endured his injury
itroubles over this past year. He missed out on the All Blacks‚Äô 2022 campaign
ias a result and, despite returning for the Crusaders at the start of the
iseason, the flanker has only featured once since late March. Had the
i28-year-old been fit and firing, he was a certainty for the 36.
