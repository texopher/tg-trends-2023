iLyndon Dykes and Kenny McLean scored dramatic late goals as Scotland stunned
iNorway to make it nine points out of nine in Group A
i
i===== Live feed =====
i
iNext up for Scotland: Georgia at Hampden on Tuesday night. I’ll leave you
iwith Jamie Jackson’s match report. Thanks for your company and emails –
igoodnight.
i
iThe captain Andy Robertson, who was superb at both ends of the pitch, speaks
i
iWe’ve got a really excited changing room. It’s the hottest conditions we’ve
iplayed in for a long time – the heat was incredible – so we knew our bench
iwould come into play. The lads who came on did so well.
i
iWe went into camp last week. It was tough work to be fair! Boys finished at
idifferent times of the season, so it was trying to get the balance right
ibetween fitness and freshness. Then we got the weekend off, came back this
iweek and we’ve just been preparing for this game. I think we prepared pretty
iperfectly.
i
iThe big thing is that we didn’t panic when we went 1-0 down. They probably
idropped off a bit which played to our advantage. We started getting on the
iball. We brought on wee Billy [Gilmour], who’s been magnificent in the last
i6-8 weeks for Brighton. In training he’s been so good this week, and then he
ibrought it on the pitch. Kenny comes on and scores such a vital goal. That’s
iwhat it’s so important we’ve got the whole squad.
i
iWhen we scored one, I just had a feeling we might get another one. It
ihappened so quick. The team spirit is second to none, it’s so good. To create
ithat in international football is quite unique, but we’ve got it. We always
isocialise, we always try and do things together as a country, and I think you
ican see that on the field.
i
iWe’ve got a massive country. We couldn’t have started this campaign much
ibetter, but we have to use it to our advantage. We have to qualify now.
i
i“If Scotland received an ‘intravenous hit of belief’,” says Ian Copestake,
i“then Norway have been left outside A&E while Perfect Day plays.”
i
iHaha. Imagine Haaland as Renton, when Pep leaves him out of a League Cup game
iat home to Gillingham. “I appreciate what you’re trying to do, Pep, I really
ido…”
i
i“I admit, I let out a long, weary sigh when I saw McLean coming on,” says
iJames Humphries. “Guess that’s why I’m not an international football coach,
ieh?”
i
iSometimes, humble pie tastes more delicious than anything in the world. Even
ilutefisk.
i
iThe champagne moments

iLYNDON DYKES! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🔥 The @QPR man pokes the ball into the net for
ithe equaliser against Norway 👏#EURO2024 | #NORSCO | @ScotlandNT

i
iSCOTLAND HAVE DONE IT! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Two goals in three minutes and Kenny
iMcLean has scored what could be a historic winner 😱😱#EURO2024 | #NORSCO |

i
i“Wow,” says Simon McMahon. “That’s a helluva win for Scotland, Rob. Snatching
ivictory from the jaws of defeat is not normally the Scottish way of doing
ithings. Quite the opposite, in fact. Would seem harder now not to qualify,
ithough if any team can… Ach, stop it. Football, eh? Bloody hell.”
i
iMartin Odegaard is disconsolate; all the Norway players are. They’ve been
imugged in their own home. Norway dominated the game throughout, albeit
iwithout
icreating too many clear chances, and took the lead through a penalty from the
iinevitable Erling Haaland. Then they took Haaland off in the 84th minute, and
iit all went wrong, big time.
i
iLyndon Dykes pilfered an equaliser after a defensive mix-up, then Kenny
iMcLean scored a delightful goal to give Scotland an unbelievable victory.
iThere’s work to do, and Scotland fans will never assume, but this has been an
iunimaginably good start to the qualification. They’ve beaten Cyprus, Spain
iand
inow Norway, which puts them eight points clear of Norway in the (theoretical)
irace for second.
i
i===== Full time: Norway 1-2 Scotland =====
i
iThree games, nine points: Scotland are closing in on a place at Euro 2024,
ialready.
i
i90+5 min Ryerson’s cross is cut out by the stretching Robertson. Norway come
iagain…
i
i90+4 min Talk about seizing the moment. Scotland were poor going forward for
i87 minutes, and that’s being kind, but the unexpected equaliser gave them an
iintravenous hit of belief and they charged forward in pursuit of a winner.
i
i90+3 min Free-kick to Norway 30 yards from goal. Odegaard tries to play it
iout to the left-back Meling – and overhits it for a goalkick! Blimey.
i
i90 min There will be six minutes of added time. John McGinn is replaced by
ithe debutant Dominic Hyam.
i
iA reminder that Norway took Erling Haaland off at 1-0.
i
iThis is spine-tingling stuff! Kenny McLean has given Scotland the lead with a
imarvellous team goal! McTominay, on the right, arrowed a long cross towards
iMcGinn on the far side of the area. McGinn reversed it instantly to Dyche,
iwho
ilaid it off carefully to the onrushing McLean. He opened his body to slide an
ialmost nonchalant right-footed curler through the crowd of defenders. It
ishimmered all along the ground and into the far corner; Nyland had no chance.
i
iTwo first-time passes and then an immaculate first-time finish. What a
ibrilliant goal!
i
i===== GOAL! Norway 1-2 Scotland (McLean 89) =====
i
iI can’t spake!!!!
i
iThat came out of nothing. McGinn’s through pass towards McLean was cut out
iwell on the edge of the area by Ostigard, but then all the Norway defenders
ileft the loose ball to each other. That allowed Dykes, always on the lookout
ifor scraps, to galumph into the area and flick the ball slowly, beautifully
ipast the outrushing Nyland.
i
i===== GOAL! Norway 1-1 Scotland (Dykes 87) =====
i
iA huge goal for Scotland!
i
i86 min Steve Clarke is unhappy that Ryerson isn’t booked for pulling back
iMcGinn and stalling a Scotland break. He’s probably got a point.
i
i85 min Odegaard turns majestically in the area and hits a right-footed
istinger that is blocked by Hendry.
i
i84 min: Triple substitution for Norway Jorgen Larsen, Mats Moller Daehli and
iKristian Thorstvedt (son of Erik) replace Patrick Berg, Fredrik Aursnes and
iErling Haaland. Why would you take him off? I didn’t realise Ben Stokes was
iNorway manager.
i
i82 min Haaland deliberately flattens Hickey and is a bit fortunate not to be
ibooked.
i
i79 min: Norway substitution Mohamed Elyounoussi comes on for Alexander
iSorloth.
i
i78 min: Scotland substitutions x3 Billy Gilmour, Kenny McLean and Stuart
iArmstrong replace Callum McGregor, Ryan Christie and Ryan Porteous.
i
i76 min Robertson is back on and seems okay. But Scotland don’t look like
iscoring I’m afraid. Their only shot on target was by McGinn just after
ihalf-time.
i
i74 min In fact Robertson was caught on his left achilles by Sorloth as they
icompeted for a loose ball. He’s still being treated.
i
i73 min Andy Robertson is down, which is an obvious worry for Scotland. It
ilooks like an ankle problem.
i
i70 min: Chance for Norway! Aursnes’s inswinging corner is headed across goal
iand wide by Berge, eight yards out. He was moving slightly away from goal but
iit was still a really good opportunity.
i
i70 min Sorloth cuts inside from the right, just outside the area, and hits a
icurling shot that nicks off Cooper’s shoulder and flies this far wide of the
ifar post.
i
i69 min “Your update about the boiling and roasting weather made me dust off
imy copy of the Gilberto Gil album O Sol de Oslo (The Sun of Oslo),” writes
iPeter Oh. “It’s now soundtracking your blog here under the warming morning
isun
iof Northern California.
i
i“I hope the Scotland players have applied plenty of sunblock with a high HPF
i– Haaland Protection Factor.”
i
i68 min Scotland have had loads more possession since Haaland’s goal, such is
ihuman nature. For now it’s all in front of the Norway defence.
i
iErling Haaland makes the difference for the opening goal 🇳🇴 Ryan Porteous
ibrings down the @ManCity striker to give away the penalty, and he makes no
imistake from there 💥#EURO2024 | #NORSCO pic.twitter.com/rXtgtRoK9k
i
i67 min Hickey seems to be fouled 25 yards out in a central position, but the
ireferee isn’t interested. He hasn’t had a great game.
