i3:28 said the clock that ticked along sheepishly on the scoreboard of the
igiant, black bowl, plonked in the sand like it had fallen from the back of a
ispaceship; Allegiant Stadium will not host a game at the 2026 World Cup, and
iit will probably never host a game like Mexico vs Panama. After just a few
iminutes, Jesús Gallardo turned the 0 into a 1 for Mexico yet the silence
iradiating through the stands that circled effortlessly around the pitch was
iwhat grabbed the attention of the few people actually watching it, eyes
islicing from side to side: are we allowed to cheer?
i
iMexico’s slump to a devastating defeat against the USMNT in the semi-finals
iof the Concacaf Nations League is already presenting the consequences. Diego
iCocca’s side took on the other losing semi-finalist, Panama, who fell to
iCanada, in the third-place playoff. El Tri’s game in the semi, before being
imarred by violent scenes, red cards and homophobic chants, was characterised
iby the ferociously passionate fans that had turned out to support their team
iin green, white and red.
i
iThen the patience ran out.

iAgainst Panama, the Mexican fans did not show up, with the good feelings
itowards their team finally using up all the fuel that was left to burn as the
iblack seats inside Allegiant Stadium just moments before kick-off, in stark
icontrast to the game just days before, stood as 61,000 reminders for the
iplayers what they were responsible for.
i
iThe fans have had enough of the lack of direction from the FMF, the
imanagement and the on-pitch decisions, with even the players seemingly at
iodds
iwith what message they want to put out. Edson Álvarez claimed that fans and
ijournalists have “no patience”, while Santi Giménez said that Mexico “weren’t
iup to the task” against a far superior USMNT. Confusion is seeping from all
isides of the divide.

iI don’t think I’ve ever seen this before, Mexico is playing in the third
iplace game in @CNationsLeague and the stadium is empty.. I am in shock !!!

iDiego Cocca has been criticised heavily since the defeat, with rumours of a
iplayer boycott circling. Ahead of the game against Panama, the Argentine
icoach
ispoke of the analysis post-USA game and how Mexico plan on turning things
iaround: “This is football and it lets you have revenge. The night of the game
iagainst the United States was tough, it hurt a lot, but we got on with
ianalysing our mistakes, to see what we did well and badly, what we need to
ilearn to not do the same again. We talked about individual and collective
ierrors; we took responsibility for it and agreed on what to do. Then we
ianalysed Panama”, he said.
i
i“Tomorrow (18 June), we are going to go out onto the pitch convinced we can
ido our best, believing in the project”, Cocca continued, “we have the chance
ito show we are alive and that we want the best for the National team. The
iplayers are all here, excited and wanting to turn things around. The players
iare hurt but the way to face up to it is taking it on, getting positive
iconclusions and trying not to make the same mistakes, to keep growing.”
