i
iMax Verstappen made it six victories from eight races in 2023 with a dominant
idisplay during Sunday’s Canadian Grand Prix, leading home the Aston Martin of
iFernando Alonso and Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton, as Red Bull maintained their
i100% winning record for the season so far.
i
iVerstappen’s lights-to-flag triumph also gave Red Bull their 100th victory in
ithe sport, 18 years on from the team’s debut, while the Dutchman made more
ihistory by drawing level with the legendary Ayrton Senna on 41 wins –
iextending his championship lead in the process.
i
iAlonso and Hamilton traded places on multiple occasions throughout the race,
iHamilton getting the jump at the start but falling back behind when the
istrategies unfolded, meaning it was the Spaniard who finished runner-up to
ithe
irecord-setting Verstappen.
i
iGeorge Russell missed out on a potential podium fight in the other Mercedes
iafter an early crash caused major damage to his car and dropped him to the
ifoot of the order, with the resulting Safety Car leading to different
istrategic approaches.
i
iFerrari duo Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz were two of only five drivers –
ialong with Red Bull’s Perez, Haas man Kevin Magnussen and Alfa Romeo’s
iValtteri Bottas – to stay out under the Safety Car, giving them track
iposition
ithat they converted into P4 and P5 respectively.
i
iPerez took a lonely sixth, and the fastest lap bonus point, as he did his
ibest to limit the damage after a third successive compromised qualifying
isession, while Albon made the most of his top 10 starting spot – and a
iwell-timed single stop under the Safety Car – to give Williams a
imuch-welcomed
ihaul of points in seventh.
i
iAlbon had to fend off a train of cars in the closing stages of the race that
iincluded Alpine’s Esteban Ocon, McLaren’s Lando Norris, the aforementioned
iBottas and Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll, benefitting from the upgraded FW45’s
istrong straight-line speed.
i
iNorris would lose his points finish after the chequered flag, though, having
ibeen given a five-second penalty for “unsportsmanlike conduct” behind the
iSafety Car, the McLaren man accused of backing up the pack to clear the way
ifor a McLaren ‘double-stack’ in the pits.
i
iThat meant Norris dropped to P13, behind team mate Oscar Piastri and the
iother Alpine of Pierre Gasly, with the final points of the day going to
iStroll
iand Bottas – the Canadian managing to pass the Finn late on to gain an extra
iplace.
i
iAfter dropping from second to fifth on the grid due to his red flag breach in
iqualifying, Nico Hulkenberg experienced an anonymous afternoon en route to
i15th, behind the lead AlphaTauri of Yuki Tsunoda, having lost out with a stop
ijust before the Safety Car and the Haas team’s general lack of
icompetitiveness
ion race day.
i
iZhou Guanyu was 16th in the second of the Alfa Romeo machines, while
iMagnussen and AlphaTauri’s Nyck de Vries wound up 17th and 18th respectively
iafter two collisions midway through the race that led to them both running
ioff
ithe track.
i
iHaving initially continued after his crash and worked his way back into the
ipoints, Russell was later told to retire amid brake worries, with Logan
iSargeant the other non-finisher when the Williams rookie was asked to park
ihis
icar in the early stages.

i
iAfter Saturday’s wet and wild qualifying session, weather conditions improved
isignificantly overnight and drivers were greeted by an almost completely dry
iCircuit Gilles Villeneuve when they turned up for the race – slicks very much
ithe order of the day when it came to lights out.
i
iHowever, there were several changes to the starting order post-qualifying,
iwith Hulkenberg dropping from the front row to P5 for a red flag violation,
ias
iSainz (demoted to 11th), Stroll (16th) and Tsunoda (19th) also lost three
iplaces for separate instances of impeding across Q1 and Q2.
i
iAccording to F1 tyre supplier Pirelli, the best strategic route for the race
iwould be finely poised between a two-stop (medium-hard-hard) and a one-stop
i(hard-medium) – but Hamilton, Russell, Leclerc and Sainz were four drivers
iwho
ionly had one set of hards available.
i
iWhen the tyre blankets came off the cars, with Leclerc’s featuring a repaired
iplank due to damage sustained on his lap to the grid, it was revealed that
ithe
imajority had selected medium starting rubber, while Perez, Magnussen and
iBottas chose hards and only Gasly went for softs.
i
iA few moments later, it was time for the eagerly anticipated race start,
ipole-sitter Verstappen making a clean getaway to hold the lead into Turn 1,
iwhile Hamilton charged his way past Alonso and Russell almost followed him
ithrough, only to back out and remain fourth.
i
iOcon got the jump on Hulkenberg to run fifth, followed by McLaren pair
iPiastri and Norris, as Leclerc and Albon occupied the final top 10 positions
ifrom a squabbling Sainz and Perez, who almost clashed at the Turn 8/9 chicane
iwhen the Ferrari ran deep and clattered over the kerbs.
i
iThere was further drama just a few corners later when Sainz fought back
iagainst Perez down the back straight and into the final chicane, with a
ifast-approaching Magnussen almost running into the Red Bull when the braking
izone all but disappeared in front of him.
i
iAs the race approached the five-lap mark, race leader Verstappen sat just
iover a second clear of Hamilton, crucially keeping him out of the DRS window
ithat would otherwise leave him exposed along the circuit’s long straights.
i
iAt the same time, replays showed third-place Alonso thumping the wall at the
iexit of Turn 4, but there was seemingly no damage to report as the two-time
iworld champion held on to P3 between the Mercedes machines – and began to
ireel
iin Hamilton.
i
i“I think the tyres are more vulnerable than FP2,” Verstappen then reported
iover the radio, given the much ‘greener’ track conditions after the rainfall.
iWith the long-game in mind, Tsunoda had already pitted to swap his medium
ityres for hards.

i
iAs Verstappen expressed those initial tyre concerns, Sargeant had even more
ito worry about when the Williams pit wall told him to stop his car with a
i“critical message” – briefly bringing out a Virtual Safety Car while marshals
igot to work.
i
iWhen the VSC ended, Verstappen’s advantage over Hamilton stood at a slightly
iincreased three seconds, with Alonso another second adrift in third, Russell
ihanging on in fourth, Ocon still holding fifth and Hulkenberg losing a
iposition at Turn 1 to Piastri. Hulkenberg then pitted before Norris could
irepeat his team mate’s move.
i
iJust after Verstappen reported that he had hit a bird, Russell experienced
isignificant contact of his own when he hopped over the kerbs at Turn 8/9 and
islammed into the wall at the exit, bringing out the Safety Car and leading to
ia sweary radio message from the Briton.
i
iFront-runners Verstappen, Hamilton and Alonso opted to pit under caution on
iLap 12 of 70, swapping mediums for hards, with the stewards noting a possible
iunsafe release when replays showed the Mercedes emerging just in front of the
iAston Martin, while also looking into potential overtaking from Ocon, Bottas
iand Magnussen under the Safety Car.
i
iWhile most of the field pitted, with the top three remaining unchanged,
iLeclerc, Sainz, Perez, Magnussen and Bottas all stayed on the track to occupy
ipositions four to eight, as Ocon and Piastri completed the points-paying
iplaces for the time being. Hulkenberg, Stroll, Gasly and De Vries all lost
iout
iwith stops just before the Safety Car emerged.
i
i“It’s a bit bent, but it’s OK,” Russell reported over the radio after lengthy
irepairs in the pit lane that kept him in the race but all the way down in
i19th, giving him plenty to do when the action resumed on Lap 17 – Verstappen
imastering the restart and bolting away up front.
i
iWith the front-running positions unchanged, it was left to Norris to provide
ithe action as he pulled a move on team mate Piastri into the hairpin, moments
ibefore the stewards issued another note to confirm that the former was being
iinvestigated for an unsafe release of his own.
i
iA few minutes on, it was communicated that none of the aforementioned
istewards’ reviews would lead to any further action, meaning Hamilton, Alonso,
iNorris, Ocon, Bottas and Magnussen could race on without a penalty hanging
iover them – for now, at least.
i
iBack up front, Verstappen had stretched his lead to around three seconds –
igetting close to his pre-Safety Car advantage – while Alonso closed on
iHamilton for P2, got a run down the back straight and completed the move at
ithe final chicane.
i
iThe yet-to-stop Leclerc and Sainz followed in fourth and fifth, from Ocon,
iBottas, Norris and Piastri – Magnussen dropping to 11th after being told by
ihis Haas team to give a position back to Ocon and losing further ground to
iBottas and Norris when he did so.

i
iStruggling to make an impression in his home race, Stroll pitted for a second
itime as the race neared its halfway mark, putting him at the back of the
ipack,
ibehind the recovering Russell, but crucially moving into some clear air –
iHulkenberg doing the same soon afterward.
i
i“I have no grip on this tyre,” Verstappen commented as the leader’s second
istint developed, before reporting that the “grip is getting better” a few
ilaps
ilater, while Sainz resisted Ferrari’s calls to pit and asked to continue on
ihis original set of mediums.
i
iFollowing their initial rush of activity, the stewards were soon called into
iaction again, with Norris’ actions in the cockpit coming under the microscope
ionce more. This time it was for driving “unnecessarily slowly” under the
iSafety Car to free up space and allow both McLaren cars to pit at the same
itime – duly landing a five-second penalty.
i
iAlready making steady progress in his recovery drive, Russell benefitted from
ia clash between De Vries and Magnussen at Turn 2 on Lap 36. The pair banged
iwheels again when the AlphaTauri lunged up the inside of the Haas under
ibraking for Turn 4, both drivers taking to the run-off and the stewards
inoting
ithat incident as well.
i
iWhile the top six drivers pounded around – Leclerc, Sainz and Perez still yet
ito pit – there were plenty of stops up and down the order as the various
ipost-Safety Car strategies played out, meaning a constant shuffling of the
itiming screen.
i
iPerez would pit on Lap 38, though, with Sainz and Leclerc following him in
iover the next couple of tours, the trio coming back out in the same order and
iahead of the chasing pack led by Albon, as attention turned to what the
ifront-runners would do.
i
iHamilton offered the first answer by moving back to mediums on Lap 41, before
iAlonso took on another set of hards one tour later, and leader Verstappen
iresponding to that by bolting on a set of the yellow-marked rubber, keeping
ipositions as they were at the head of the field.
i
iDown at Ferrari, Leclerc was given the message “Sainz will not attack you”,
ithe team mates both running hards and sitting a few seconds clear of
imedium-shod Perez, with Albon, Russell, Ocon (all hards) and Bottas (mediums)
iholding the final top 10 places.
i
i“Tell me when lift and coast is OK, I want to stop doing it… I want to win
ithe race, mate!” Alonso shouted over the radio as the race headed into its
ifinal 20 laps, Hamilton – who had eyed a “good battle” with his old rival
ipre-race – beginning to close on softer tyres.
i
iMeanwhile, behind the top six runners, the apparently one-stopping Albon was
idoing a very solid job of keeping his Williams in front of Russell’s
iMercedes,
ialbeit the W14 nursing damage, allowing Ocon, Bottas and Norris to close in
iand setting up the prospect of a thrilling multi-car scrap.
i
iOn Lap 55, Russell was removed from that fight when Mercedes told him to pit
iand retire due to brake concerns, briefly taking some of the pressure off
iAlbon before the aforementioned train of Ocon, Bottas, Norris and now Stroll
ifilled the gap.
i
iAs the laps ticked by, Hamilton embarked on another push to temporarily get
iwithin a second-and-a-half of Alonso, who appeared to be nursing his own
ibrake
iproblems. But the Aston Martin man found some more pace in response and told
ithe pit wall “leave it to me”.
i
iAt this point, there was a scare for leader Verstappen. “I almost knocked
imyself out on that kerb,” he laughed over the radio with five laps to go,
ihaving come perilously close to repeating Russell’s earlier off at Turn 8/9.
i
iThat was the only problem he would face on his way to another crushing win,
ithough, crossing the line almost 10 seconds clear of Alonso, while Hamilton’s
iattack faded and he dropped almost five seconds away from his former team
imate.
i
iLeclerc and Sainz maintained fourth and fifth to give Ferrari a solid haul of
ipoints after their qualifying troubles, with Perez taking sixth and the
ifastest lap bonus thanks to a late stop for a set of soft tyres.
i
iAlbon maintained his fine defence to the finish to keep seventh on his
ione-stop strategy, just in front of Ocon and Norris, who had passed Bottas –
ianother one-stopper – six laps from the end, but the McLaren driver dropped
iall the way back to P13 when his time penalty was applied.
i
iStroll also cleared Bottas in the closing laps as they rounded out the
ipoints, with Piastri and Gasly narrowly missing out on a reward for their
iefforts and slotting in front of the demoted Norris.
i
iTsunoda and Hulkenberg were next up in respective P14 and P15 positions, the
iGerman’s post-qualifying grid drop only the start of a downfall that
ireplicated several other race-day slumps from the Haas team this season.
i
iThe final drivers to finish were Zhou, Magnussen and De Vries, the latter two
isurviving their wheel banging, as Russell and Sargeant propped up the rear
iafter retiring from proceedings.
i
i“Of course, I’m very happy right now,” said race winner Verstappen. “It was
inot a very straightforward race, because the tyres were not really getting in
itheir window. It was very cold today compared to Friday and we were sliding
iaround quite a bit, but we made it work. To win again [and] win the 100th
iGrand Prix for the team is incredible.”
i
iThe next stop on the 2023 F1 calendar will be Spielberg’s Red Bull Ring for
ithe Austrian Grand Prix weekend, which takes place from June 30 to July 2.
