iTaiwanese-Canadian billionaire businessman, lawyer, and philanthropist (born
i1964)
i
iJoe Tsai
i
iTaipei, Taiwan
i
iJoseph Tsai (Chinese: 蔡崇信; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Chhòa Chông-sìn; born January 1964)[2]
iis a Taiwanese-Canadian billionaire businessman, lawyer, and
iphilanthropist.[3][4] He is a co-founder and executive vice chairman of the
iChinese multinational technology company Alibaba Group and owns the Brooklyn
iNets of the American National Basketball Association (NBA), the New York
iLiberty of the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA), the San Diego
iSeals of the National Lacrosse League, and has interests in several other
iprofessional sports franchises. Tsai holds Hong Kong and Canadian
ipassports.[5][1] Tsai's net worth is estimated to be US$8.1 billion.[4]
i
i===== Early life =====
i
iTsai was born in Taipei, Taiwan, to Paul C. Tsai (Chinese: 蔡中曾; Pe̍h-ōe-jī:
iChhòa Tiong-cheng, d.2013),[6] a second-generation lawyer, and Ruby Tsai. He
ihas three younger siblings: Eva, Vivian, and Benjamin.[7]
i
iThe Tsai family had escaped to Taiwan as part of the Kuomintang exodus after
ithe communists took over control of Mainland China in 1949 during the Chinese
iCivil War. At age 13, Tsai was sent to the U.S. to attend the Lawrenceville
iSchool in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, where he played both lacrosse and
ifootball (inside linebacker) and was a member of Cleve House.[8] Tsai
ienrolled
iat his father's alma mater, Yale University. He played for the Yale varsity
ilacrosse team for four years and has remained a supporter of the team.[9]
i
iTsai earned a B.A. in economics and East Asian studies from Yale College in
i1986. In 1990, he earned a J.D. from Yale Law School, where he was articles
ieditor of the Yale Law & Policy Review.[10][4]
i
i===== Career =====
i
iTsai became a tax associate at the white-shoe law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell
iafter graduation[11] and was admitted as an attorney to the New York bar on 6
iMay 1991.[12] After three years at the law firm, he switched to private
iequity
iand joined Rosecliff, Inc., a small management buyout firm based in New York,
ias vice president and general counsel. He left for Hong Kong in 1995 to join
ithe Swedish Wallenberg family's investment conglomerate Investor AB, where he
iwas responsible for its Asian private equity investments.[13]
i
iIt was in this role that he first met Jack Ma in 1999 in Hangzhou after being
iintroduced by a friend who was trying to sell his own company to Ma. Tsai was
iimpressed with Ma's idea to create an international import and export
imarketplace, as well as his charismatic personality, but it was Ma's
ifollowers
iand their energy and enthusiasm that ultimately convinced Tsai.[14] Later
ithat
iyear he quit the $700,000-a-year job at Investor AB and offered to join Ma as
ia member of the founding team for almost nothing. At the time each of
iAlibaba's 18 co-founders—of which Tsai was the only Western-educated
imember—accepted a salary of only $600 a year. He served as chief operating
iofficer, chief financial officer, and founding board member. He
isingle-handedly established Alibaba's financial and legal structure, since no
iother member of the team had any experience in venture capital or law. In May
i2013, he became Alibaba's executive vice chairman. He has become the
isecond-largest individual shareholder of Alibaba after Ma.[13][15]
i
i===== Sports ownership =====
i
iIn September 2019, Tsai became the owner of the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA and
ichairman of Barclays Center. He initially invested in the NBA team in October
i2017, purchasing a 49% stake in the Nets from Russian billionaire Mikhail
iProkhorov in a deal that valued the team at $2.3 billion, with the option to
ibuy the remaining stake of the team no later than 2021.[16][17][18] Tsai
iexercised that option in August 2019, and at the same time, bought the Nets'
iarena from Prokhorov for nearly $1 billion in a separate deal.[19]
i
iTsai's ownership in the Nets includes the Long Island Nets of the NBA G
iLeague and the Nets Gaming Crew of the NBA 2K League. In January 2019, Tsai
iheaded a group that bought the WNBA's New York Liberty from The Madison
iSquare
iGarden Company.[20]
i
iAs a lacrosse varsity player at Yale, Tsai is also an avid supporter of the
ilacrosse sport. He is the owner of the San Diego Seals, and a co-owner of the
iLas Vegas Desert Dogs, both of which are professional box lacrosse teams in
ithe National Lacrosse League (NLL). Tsai co-owns the 15th NLL franchise, the
iLas Vegas Desert Dogs with Wayne Gretzky, Dustin Johnson, and Steve Nash with
ithe team based in Las Vegas. [21][22][23]
i
iHe is also chairman of J Tsai Sports with investments in the upstart field
ilacrosse league, the Premier Lacrosse League and several sports media and
itechnology companies based in North America and Asia. Tsai made his
iinvestment
iin the Premier Lacrosse League in February 2019, along with The Chernin Group
iand The Raine Group, helping fund the new lacrosse league founded by lacrosse
iplayer Paul Rabil and his brother Mike Rabil.[24]
i
iIn March 2018, Tsai joined a Michael Rubin-led group to buy the Carolina
iPanthers.[25] The bid was ultimately unsuccessful.[26]
i
iTsai is also an investor in Major League Soccer franchise Los Angeles
iFC.[27][28]
i
i===== Personal life =====
i
iTsai holds Canadian and Hong Kong dual citizenship spending much of his time
iin Vancouver and Hong Kong.[1] He is married to Clara Ming-Hua Wu, a
igranddaughter of Wu San-lien [zh], the first elected mayor of Taipei
iCity.[29]
iWu spent her childhood in Lawrence, Kansas and is a graduate of Lawrence High
iSchool. Wu also graduated from Stanford University, where she studied
iinternational relations, and has an MBA degree from Harvard Business School.
iShe is an advisor for Taobao and is a member of The Bishop's School board of
itrustees.[30][31] Tsai and Wu have three children.[32] They lived in Hong
iKong
ifor over a decade, though now primarily reside in the La Jolla neighborhood
iof
iSan Diego, California. Tsai still spends much of his time in Hong Kong for
ibusiness and still has a home in Hong Kong.[1][33][34] In January 2022, Tsai
ipaid $188 million for a penthouse at 220 Central Park South.[35]
i
i===== Politics =====
i
iOn 7 October 2019, Tsai weighed in after Houston Rockets general manager
iDaryl Morey posted a tweet supporting protesters in Hong Kong.[36] In an open
iletter to all NBA fans on his Facebook page, Tsai explained, with reference
ito
ihistorical foreign invasions of China, that Morey's tweet triggered a strong
inegative sentiment in China because of strong national sentiment against
iterritorial losses, especially those perceived to have been caused or
iescalated by foreign entities, and separatist movements.[37][38][39]
i
i===== Philanthropy =====
i
iIn March 2016, Tsai donated $30 million to his alma mater, Yale Law School,
iin honor of his father to support the continuing work of the Law School's
iChina Center and renamed it Paul Tsai China Center.[40][41]
i
iIn May 2017, Tsai and his wife, through the Joe and Clara Tsai Foundation,
imade another donation to Yale for the construction, launch, and programs of
ithe center and named it Tsai Center for Innovative Thinking. The center’s
imission is to inspire students from diverse backgrounds and disciplines to
iseek innovative ways to solve real-world problems. [42][43]
i
iIn June 2017, the Tsais, again through the Joe and Clara Tsai Foundation,
imade a donation to his high school, the Lawrenceville School, in Mercer
iCounty, New Jersey, which was the single largest gift the school ever
ireceived.[44][45][46] Tsai is a member of Lawrenceville's board of
itrustees.[47]
i
iIn late March and early April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tsais
idonated 2.6 million masks, 170,000 goggles and 2,000 ventilators to New
iYork.[48] On 20 April 2020, they donated $1.6 million of medical supplies to
ihospitals in San Diego.[49]
i
iIn August 2020, the Tsais donated $50 million to social justice and economic
iequality initiatives to support BIPOC causes.[50]
i
iIn late 2020, the Tsais committed to contribute $50 million to Lincoln Center
iand the New York Philharmonic to facilitate the accelerated acoustical
irenovation of David Geffen Hall. On August 3, 2022, Lincoln Center and the
iNew
iYork Philharmonic announced the naming of the concert hall as the Wu Tsai
iTheater, as well as the naming of a Wu Tsai Series of concerts celebrating
iinterdisciplinary works from diverse voices.[51][52]
i
iIn February 2021, the Tsais made a donation to Yale University to establish
ithe Wu Tsai Institute which will launch an ambitious research enterprise
idevoted to the study of human cognition.[53]
i
iIn July 2021, the Tsais debuted the Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance and
ipledged US$220 million to the foundation to fund teams of experts and
iacademics from Stanford University, the University of Kansas, the University
iof Oregon, University of California, San Diego, Boston Children's Hospital
iand
ithe Salk Institute for Biological Studies.[54]
