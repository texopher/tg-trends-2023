i===== Sargent received low amateur honors at major =====
i
iGordon Sargent made the cut for a golf major for the first time in his young
icareer this weekend when he got the opportunity to play all four rounds of
ithe
iU.S. Open.
i
iThe 20-year-old Alabama native finished his round Sunday with an unusual
iputt. He was trying to wrap up the round on the 18th hole at the Los Angeles
iCountry Club with a par. However, the ball appeared to bounce inside the cup
iand then went out. He would finish the hole with a bogey.

iHe had five bogeys on the day but also six birdies, shooting a 69 but
ifinishing the tournament 4 over par and well off the lead.
i
iBut the issue on the 18th raised the eyebrows of the golf world as anything
isimilar to what happened to Sargent could disrupt the final grouping on the
iday.
i
iAccording to ESPN, the cup was damaged a bit because the group before
iSargent’s had pulled the flag out wrong. The cup was reportedly fixed after
ithe putt.
